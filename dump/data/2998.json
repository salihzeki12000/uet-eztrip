This area has many interesting spots but it's too large to walk. Biking is the best way to look around this huge area. We stop by some interesting facilities and give you time to look around. Probably you want to come back to these facilities later and spend more time. That's why we end this tour in Odaiba. We finish the tour with the cruise. We again cross Rainbow Bridge but this time you will see it from the cruise ship."}
