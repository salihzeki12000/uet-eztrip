Carved through ages by natural elements, the limestone has been transformed into spectacular caves and grottos, some threading through stone pillars, other towing to cathedral heights that rise high above the emerald sea. Moreover, in natural sculptures of animals, many of these islands have been given individual names that remind of intriguing legends: Dog Island, Incense Urn Island, Fighting Cock Island, Heaven Gate Cave, Dau Go Grotto etc."}
