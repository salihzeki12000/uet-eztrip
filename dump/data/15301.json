In that way we can share our memories with friends and look\nback on our trip from time to time.\nWe like to have pictures of our favorite spots in the city, bars, buildings, and\narchitecture. We want the pictures to be as beautiful as when we saw it in that\nmoment. Unfortunately, when we see our pictures back, they don\u2019t appear to be very different or unique from others. Or they are not as special as we hoped they would be."}
