After riding your well-fed, well-cared-for horse along this awesome scene, you'll have full access to our private beach club, where you can eat, drink, relax, and swim for the whole day and relax with the staggering beauty of the Caribbean Sea as far as the eye can see. You can also choose to do another activity at this same site during your day."}
