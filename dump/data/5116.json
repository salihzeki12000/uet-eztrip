The intricacy of these majestic ruins suggests that Choquequirao was once of high importance to the Inca empire. Before a bridge was constructed over the Apruimac River the site was remote and mostly inaccessible. Luckily for explorers this bridge can now connect them to this once hidden ancient city."}
