Start out with a beautiful horseback ride through the jungle and along seeming endless strands of gleaming powder-white beaches.  Back at the ranch, we'll head for Playa Norte, where you'll get to snorkel on one of the best coral reefs in the entire Riviera Maya!  Amazing reef snorkeling, trotting along virgin beaches atop a beautiful horse - what an experience!  After you're done, you can use the beach club all day long - eating, drinking, swimming, and relaxing.  Truly a day in utopia."}
