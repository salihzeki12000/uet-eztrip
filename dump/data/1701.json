Soldiers, ammunition, weapons and supplies were carried by hand, bicycle and truck for hundreds of kilometers through the otherwise impenetrable jungle that covered Vietnam\u2019s mountainous border with Laos. A testimony to the ingenuity, fortitude and commitment of the northern Vietnamese, the trail slipped from use at the end of the war and was taken back by the jungle. Recent road works that follow original sections of the trail have changed this.\nBesides incredible riding, deep in the Vietnamese countryside, this ride takes in the charming ancient trading town of Hoian, Khe Sanh battle site and DMZ. We also take time to stay overnight in a traditional Thai hill tribe and visit to some tribal villages on the way.\nPlease note that Ho Chi Minh trail rides cost more than our standard rides as we have to pay the guide(s) and bikes back to Hanoi. In addition, food and hotel in South Vietnam cost more than in the Northern mountain parts. We also recommend you to bring your riding gear as if you get all from us, it\u2019s not easy for our guide to carry them back to Hanoi.\nThe government already built a new highway on most of the original trail. However, we still have some parts on tracks and short-cuts that offer off-road riders a chance to test out their riding skills. The riding hours are longer than a Northern Vietnam trip, however the scenery is not as beautiful as in North Vietnam. It's more about Vietnam War!"}
