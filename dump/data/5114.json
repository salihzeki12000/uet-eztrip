Many tour buses and cars drive daily between Cusco and Ollantaytambo. The area is interesting because of the history here &ndash the Spaniards suffered one of their few defeats in a direct confrontation with the Incas \u2013 but also because in Ollantaytambo many of the original Inca streets still exist.\n\nPuma Marca is a fortress built on top of a steep slope, which was built to control the entrance to the Sacred Valley from the nearby jungle. A steep climb will be rewarded with a beautiful panorama and the knowledge that you are visiting a place known by only a few tourists.\n\nAfter visiting Pumamarca, spend the night in Aguas Calientes and wake up early to visit Machu Picchu, one of the 7 Modern Wonders of the World."}
