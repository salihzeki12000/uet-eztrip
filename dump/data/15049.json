What I mean is that just like any other country turkey also has certain places, destinations. And even without any guide or tour you can find those destinations easily by yourself. But I believe that my existence should provide you distinct experiences. That's why I prefer to design an alternative tour for you; again including very beautiful and valuable places to visit, but at the same time they would let you experience what and how people live in their daily life here. I tried to answer the question 'what would I wanted to see, taste, smell if I were you'. I'd like to share my very own experiences in Turkey as a native person here and I promise you to see lots of historical places with an extra advantage: they are ultimately included in the daily life as well. So, you can feel the life here by having a perspective of an insider. Our meeting point will \u00c7emberlita\u015f tramway station or behind it where the small square is located with lots of pigeons under the \u00c7emberlita\u015f Column. Our last destination The Madrasa of \u00c7orlulu Ali Pa\u015fa is very close to both Beyaz\u0131t and \u00c7emberlita\u015f tram station where will our seperation point."}
