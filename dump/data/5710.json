Thus, they were able to combat the ever-growing dessert. The system is unique in Peru and perhaps in the whole world. In spite of the harshness of the desert, in the Nazca region still exist over 30 underground channels, which are used by local farmers, who grow mainly cotton, corn, beans and potatoes, as well as a variety of fruits. In addition to the channels, nearby visitors may also see various lines etched on the desert floor representing geometric forms, as well as the Inca ruins of Paredones."}
