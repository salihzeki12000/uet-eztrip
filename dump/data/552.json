Seeing beautiful landscapes, hearing some mysterious stories, learning some Vietnamese's culture, feeling the fresh air and training yourself. You can come to a place that look nearly the same as in the movie  \"House of Flying Daggers\". Beside will have a great time releasing your mind at a place that called to be \"the second Sapa\" of Viet Nam in a motel which has the best view in Tam Dao but not expensive :)\n\nATTENTION: we will have to walk very far in the wood (about 28km) but don't worry, it doesn't worse like you think, it is very relaxing and worth doing! And at the end of the trip, you will receive an unique  small handmade-gift from me :D"}
