Many photos can be taken along the tour, not just of the natural\u00a0things we will see\u00a0but also photos showing\u00a0the juxtaposition between nature and the cities skyscrapers in the backdrop. Botanical Gardens is truly beautiful and varied in the plants and animals you will see. From there we will head over to the Shrine of Remembrance and then down to St Kilda Road."}
