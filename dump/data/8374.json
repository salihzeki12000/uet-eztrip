First established in the fourteenth century, it quickly gained fame under the\u00a0 auspices of founder Parameswara, a Sumatran prince. Conquered by the Portuguese, Dutch and British, remnants of their rule can be seen throughout the well-preserved town centre, from Porta de Santiago (the remaining gate of the Portuguese-built A\u2019Famosa fort) to the nearby Dutch-constructed Stadhuys."}
