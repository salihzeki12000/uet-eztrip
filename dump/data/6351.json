We cycle along Amsterdam's southern waterfront to the west of the city and see the most recent urban developments in housing, culture and businesses. Also the north of Amsterdam is visible because our tour will lead to wonderful views across the water at the opposite northern waterfront. This architecture tour has it all: old- and new buildings in a splendid mix, houseboats and old cargo boats along the quays.\n\nThe cycle tour 'Along Amsterdam's Waterfront' is a revelation for every lover of architecture, the city and the waterfronts: in short it's an absolute must!"}
