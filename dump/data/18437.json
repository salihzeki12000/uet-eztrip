The high, arid\nplateau stretches more than 80 km (50 mi) between the towns of Nazca and Palpa\non the Pampas de Jumana, about 400 km south of Lima. Although some local\ngeoglyphs resemble Paracas motifs, scholars believe the Nazca Lines were\ncreated by the Nazca culture between 500 B.C. and A.D. 500 The figures vary in\ncomplexity. Hundreds are simple lines and geometric shapes; more than 70 are\nzoomorphic designs of animals, such as birds, fish, llamas, jaguars, and\nmonkeys, or human figures. Other designs include phytomorphic shapes, such as\ntrees and flowers.\u00a0The designs\nare shallow lines made in the ground by removing the reddish pebbles and\nuncovering the whitish / grayish ground beneath. The largest figures are up to\n1,200 ft (370 m) long. Scholars differ in interpreting the purpose of the\ndesigns but, in general, they ascribe religious significance to them"}
