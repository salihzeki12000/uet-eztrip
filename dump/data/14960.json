Perhaps you want to brainstorm a new idea or workshop a challenge. Maybe you feel stuck and want guidance on how to live with more meaning. Laid back Manly is the perfect setting to do this. In addition to having a job where I get to help women make lasting life change, I've also been a Manly local for over a decade. I'll be taking you on a tour of my secret spots where along the way, inspired by the fresh air and healthy lifestyle, we'll devote time just to you and whatever's on your mind."}
