Vietnam is now the world's 5th largest producer of tea but for many its products remain a mystery.  Our passion is to raise awareness of the very fine teas that are now available from across the country and to encourage people to understand and taste our teas which have been individually selected, mainly from small independent artisan producers.\n\nThe tea tasting tour is leisurely paced to suit your requirements but will typically last between 60 and 90 minutes."}
