It is not so difficult - you can get a lot of leaflets and booklets an travel guides with a broad information. But, Riga is no just the Old Town and the city centre. There is another Riga on the left bank of Daugava River - P\u0101rdaugava (the other shore of Daugava) - which is actually a mixture of old villages, beautiful parks and new quartiers of modern block houses. Real Riga and real Latvia is there - not so much in a tourist oriented Old Town. We will make a driving trip with several strolls to discover the unique old wooden architecture of Pardaugava, to visit a local market, to climb the highest mound in Riga, to explore once awesome but now quite neglected Daugavgriva fortress. Probably, we will take a coffe break, or lunch or dinner in one of the carefully restored old taverns of Agenskalns. We will visit a beautiful wild coastline area within the boundaries of Riga City! We will make short hikes to the wonderful and wild places where Daugava and Lielupe Rivers flow into the Riga Gulf and, we will enjoy a refreshing bath in Riga beach, if it is a summer."}
