Also, we have put together a few tours around a specific theme, to get to know the Shanghainese life better. If you have any specific things you want to see or learn more about, please let us know, we would love to put something tailormade together for you. \nSo, whether you are here on a holiday, a business trip or have been living here for a while, there is always something that you haven\u2019t seen!  \n\nBy the way, it is NOT dangerous to ride a bike in Shanghai, but of course you have to be careful. From our side, we have made sure that we chose the safest routes, we will never run a red light and our bikes are the safest around. That coming from a Dutch person has to count for something!\nOur guides will always make sure that they keep an eye out for you, so that you can keep an eye on the city.  \nThis tour is for the early birds among us, so consider yourself warned!"}
