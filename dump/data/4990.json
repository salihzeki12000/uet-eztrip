On the Inca Quarry trek, you will visit some little-known Inca ruins and trek through amazing landscapes as you make your way to Machu Picchu. This trek will also take you to an amazing Inca temple above Ollantatambo that was built as a shrine to the snow-capped mountian Veronica. The quarry itself will give you an insight into the incredible crafstmanship and engineering skills of the Incas. If you dare, you will even get to peer inside Incan tombs which still contain the human skeletal remains of those who chose to sacrifice themselves to the sacred mountian. You will be impressed by the history and panoramic views that this tour has to offer."}
