This city is very dear to me and I am truly proud of her and I will keep on loving her for the rest of my life. Dagupan is strategically located in the mid-northern part of the province, lying across the coastline of the Lingayen Gulf. Their is a lot of beach there. When you say premier beach destination, people would probably think of Boracay, Coron, and even Batangas. West Pangasinan is one of the most beautiful destination when somebody wants to have\u00a0list to have a vacation.The food, the ambiance, the people is so good and the prices of the food is not so expensive, affordable and irresistable. The places there is so much beautiful."}
