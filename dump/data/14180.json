Many more people swarm by whimsical trinket shops and street food dealers nearby. Tons of great sights are worth to be photographed, lovely souvenirs to be acquired and tasty snacks to be sampled. \u00a0Plus your guide knows every corner and is fluent in English and the local language, Portuguese. It's going to be fun!"}
