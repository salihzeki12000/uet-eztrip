You'll walk through a natural Alberta landscape (just minutes from Downtown and Whyte Ave), filled with a stunning array of greens sure to impress the most avid nature-lover. As well, participants will bridge the North Saskatchewan River (twice, from two different heights!) and discover a little bit of Edmonton's unique railroad history with views of Canada's tallest working tram bridge."}
