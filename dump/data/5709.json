Since 1982 the Italian Archaeologist Giuseppe Orefeci has begun a tireless work uncovering the ancient city of the Nazca people. The archaeological complex covers an area of 24 square kilometres and within its territory exist huge pyramids, temples and platforms, which are brought to light year by year by Giuseppe Orefeci and his team. The ceremonial center of Cahuachi has a great importance, as it was there where the ancient Nazca culture developed."}
