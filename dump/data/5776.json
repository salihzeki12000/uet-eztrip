Rupit is just 90 min away from the bustling metropolis but a whole different world.\nThis special day will take you right into the heart of Catalan history and culture, to a hidden valley where few of the visitors to Barcelona come. A short drive will bring us to the lake Panta de Sau deep in the Collsacabra mountain range at the foot of the Pyrenees."}
