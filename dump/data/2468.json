After the urban area, there is then a dramatic transition to scenic lush green canals that are typical in the Mekong Delta. You will begin your excursion visiting a local riverside market, a small village with colonial architecture, a local pagoda, various workshops, and narrow lush jungle canals. We are constantly exploring new routes and rarely travel to the same sights twice to make sure that you'll receive a truly unique experience. Lunch with traditional Vietnamese dishes at an orphanage will make the trip more memorable."}
