This tour is about Amsterdam's history from its beginning till present day developments. Your guide will tell you all about the famous ring of canals, water management, small boats, bigger house boats, skewed houses, gables, hoisting beams, coffeeshops and the enormous, but really enormous amount of (parked) bikes in the city :-) In short all those things you may notice when you first arrive in Amsterdam."}
