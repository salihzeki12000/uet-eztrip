The 3rd Tunnel, which is about 73 meters underground, and is 2 meters wide and high, was constructed by North Korea to infiltrate the South. It extends 435 meters, beyond the Joint Security Area. The total length of the 3rd Tunnel is 1,635 m. At the Dora observatory, you can look through a telescope into the edges of North Korea.  The North Koreans are unquestionably some of the most secretive human beings alive today.  They know we can peer into their country from this observation point. Take what you see with a grain of salt."}
