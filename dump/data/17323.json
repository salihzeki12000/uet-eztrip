For centuries, Bhutan remain undiscovered by the rest of the world. A conscious policy of isolation complemented by formidable geographical barriers has enabled the country to maintain its independence throughout its history. The Kingdom ended its self-imposed isolation only in 1961 and embarked on the path of modern development in a fine balance with its ancient traditions. One of the main attractions for international visitors is the country's culture and traditions. Bhutanese tradition is deeply steeped in its Buddhist heritage. Due to its largely unspoilt natural environment and cultural heritage, Bhutan has aptly been referred to as The Last Shangri-La."}
