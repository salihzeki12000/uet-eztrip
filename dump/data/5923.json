Explore the winding medieval streets of the Jewish quarter, walk along the Roman wall that surrounds the old town, or discover the Arab Baths.  \n\nAfterwards, we visit the pristine mediaeval village of Pals before heading down the coastal route to admire the breath-taking sea-views, cliffs and coves of the Costa Brava.\n\nWe stop in Calella de Palafrugell where you can walk around the rocky coast, sunbathe and swim, or visit the  botanical gardens set on the cliff tops of Cap Roig."}
