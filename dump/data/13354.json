I am planning to show you all my best shops, bars, restaurants, generally areas that I love in this city. Hopefully Thessaloniki is a city that could walked on. The distancies are small and the places pretty close to each other. You can take a taste of everything is happening in the city and several music,art,street festivals but this is depends on the date you are planning to visit us."}
