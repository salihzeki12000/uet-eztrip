We'll explore US art-forms created through nature, music, journalism, architecture, literature, and the performing arts. But what may be most exciting is the personalized work of art each member of the tour will quickly cultivate throughout the journey. I, a self-taught abstract artist, will guide you through my creative process of layered abstract painting as we drift and gain inspiration down the streets of DC."}
