It is fantastic way to get there by bicycles. Wow, a healthy trip, rewarding you with fresh seafood from a local fish market there.\nThe sea there is gray due to alluvium then swimming there is not a good idea. \nBut on the cycling path, you can enjoy the mangroves jungle and truly fresh air. No crowded stress as D1, you will find Can Gio is totally different from other places of HCMC. And Bicycling is the best way to explore this area"}
