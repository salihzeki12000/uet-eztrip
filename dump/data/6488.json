We visit stands known and loved by locals, stands that have been around for generations.  You\u2019ll experience the life of a local as you stroll the streets of Vallarta, stopping to eat outside, alongside regulars. In addition to street food, we visit two of Vallarta\u2019s oldest Cenaduria restaurants, both proudly family-owned. The Street leaves you feeling more connected to Vallarta\u2019s street food scene. After The Street Tour, you will feel more comfortable continuing to explore this wonderful city and its culinary magic. This tour is not recommended for vegetarians."}
