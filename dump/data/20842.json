The name derives from hunter-explorer Frederick Courtenay Selous, a\nkeen naturalist and conservationist as well as a hunter. He was killed in the\nFirst World War in the Beho Beho region of the reserve. The defining feature of\nthe Selous is the great Rufiji River, which naturally splits the ecosystem into\ntwo distinct parts. The area can be explored by boat, sailing through swamps\nand lagoons where elephant often come to bathe, or even by foot, as the Selous\nis one of few Tanzanian reserves to allow walking tours. It has the world\u2019s\nlargest number of big game, more than 120,000 elephants, 160,000 buffaloes and\nabout 2,000 rhinoceros. In addition, the Selous contains Africa\u2019s greatest\nconcentration of hippopotamus, crocodiles and wild dogs."}
