Recently, it has been renovated. Vevey is famous because of Nestle. Its headquarters is situated here because from this small town Nestle Henry started the research in Baby formulas and then slowly got involved in famous chocolate production. Switzerland itself is famous because of its delicious chocolates and cheese. Swiss people cherish there history and one of the examples is keeping there culture alive. It has four Museams, Le Mus\u00e9e Jenisch Vevey, Mus\u00e9e l'histoire de Vevey, Alimentarium, and Museum of Photography. Le Mus\u00e9e Jenisch is worth seeing for the art lovers in their free time. Alimentarium is a Nestle Museum where it tells its history of startup and of food. Walking on the lake which is famous with the name of Lac du Leman, is another pleasurable experience. One can also take cruise ships from the bay going to either Montreux or further up. For Museum visit, one should plan seperately."}
