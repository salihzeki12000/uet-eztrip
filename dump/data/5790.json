The Gothic Quarter is packed with history, interesting details, nice plazas, beautiful churches and cozy streets.\nThe density of imposing buildings scattered around the narrow streets of the medieval city core bear witnesses to a rich history from a time when Barcelona was a super power in the Mediterranean together with cities like Venice and Genova. It was here the famous Inquisition spread fear and that Columbus was received by the Catholic Kings when he came back to Spain after discovering America.\n\nThe Barcelona Gothic Quarter Tour takes you through the most important sights of the Gothic Quarter in Barcelona, from the Cathedral of Barcelona (La Seu), the cobbled streets of the Born area, the narrow streets of the old Jewish Quarter (the Call) to the Roman ruins."}
