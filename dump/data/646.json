Spot monkeys and gibbons swinging through the trees at Vam Sat. Feed the crocodiles at the crocodile reserve and paddle around the still waters of the bat lagoon in a small wooden boat. See villagers hand-knotting nets before spreading them out to dry in the sun at a local fishing hamlet. \nA breakfast of pastries, fresh fruits andVietnamese coffee will be served as we depart Saigon, and Vietnamese specialties on-board for lunch."}
