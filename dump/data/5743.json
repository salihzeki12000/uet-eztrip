Explore the citadel of Machu Picchu at your own pace with an english speaking guide and learn about the Inca world. The sanctuary of Machu Picchu covers an area of about one square mile, and stands in a region that the Incas considered to be magical, due to the meeting of the Andes mountains with the mysterious Peruvian jungle. Seeing Peru's Machu Picchu is quite an epic experience even when it's teeming with people. Our Machu Picchu program will allow you also time for hiking and climbing."}
