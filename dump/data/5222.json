Can\u2019t think of a better day. Golf one of the most scenic and challenging golf courses in B.C. at Sand Piper Golf course in Harrison Mills. After the round of golf have a great lunch and a cocktail then jump into one of our waiting jet boats at the golf course dock and spend the afternoon sturgeon and/or salmon fishing on the beautiful Harrison river or Fraser river. You\u2019ll be back to the dock by 7:00 for a wonderful dinner and drinks at the restaurant.\n\nThis is an excellent adventure for the avid golfer and angler. Very popular for birthday gifts and/or anniversary gifts. Hint, Hint ladies\u2026. Lots of couples join us each year who are looking to spend a great day together. Awesome accommodations are available at the golf course as well. Cozy cabins and historical themed rooms. You won\u2019t be disappointed with this package."}
