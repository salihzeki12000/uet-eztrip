I will take you through all of the important landmarks and monuments. Starting from the St. Paul's Cathedral to the Kalighat temple and through the streets of the book district (College street) and many other places which most guides or travel agencies won't have on their list. Since you are in West-Bengal I won't let you leave without making you try the fresh fish that one of the best restaurants, serving Bengali cuisine, has to offer. Since I am huge foodie myself and I have been to almost all the restaurants in the city, finding the right restaurant for your preferred cuisine won't be a problem at all. Here's a list of the other places that I'll take you to. I have highlighted a few of them below:1) Victoria memorial.2) Indian Museum.3) Marble palace Zoo.4) Alipore Zoo.5) National Library.6) Birla Mandir.8) Nandan.9) Academy of Fine arts.\u00a010) Raj Bhavan (which will basically be a walk through Red road and its surrounding areas)."}
