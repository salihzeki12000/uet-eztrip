First of all because it allows you to switch from the sea to the mountains in just 30 minutes; Secondly because you can feel the many local flavors, of course we talk about food! (\"sardella\", \"nduja\", \"soppressata\", \"salsiccia\", \"provola\", \"pecorino\", and many others). The last but no the least, because the Calabria is a land full of history: Greek, Byzantine, Arab, Roman, Aragonese, evryone has had some influence and we can see the signs still today!"}
