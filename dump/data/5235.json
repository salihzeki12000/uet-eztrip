Then off to Qoricancha the most important Inca Sun Temple, once a glittering palace. Continue by transport above Cusco to the nearby ruins of Saqsayhuaman, a religious site for the Incas but called a fortress by the Spaniards. Be amazed by the huge large  carved granite stones. Thereafter, we go to Qenqo (labyrinth or zigzag) thought to have been used for death rituals and to embalm bodies by the Incas. We continue to Puca Pukara an Inca military lookout with large walls, terraces and staircases. Finally we visit Tambomachay the Inca baths consisting of four walls built directly into a hillside. After a glorious time we return to Cusco."}
