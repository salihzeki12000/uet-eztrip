But do you know who you are? Chefs do. They create a passion play every day with just the right mix of sugar and spice until you lay it all bare right there on the table.\u00a0They might not share their recipes but the secret ingredient is the story under the table. Their story. All I had to was look and I found a melting pot of all that's cooking. Done to perfection and laden with all the ingredients that get this city's juices flowing. My triip will make you experience the diverse flavors of Toronto and exciting stories behind those flavors."}
