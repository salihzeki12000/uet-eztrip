Reading a story is just the beginning of this enlightening experience when you are paired with a small group of children, ages 3-10 years old, at their school. Your entertaining questions will keep the kids attentive while at the same time improving their listening and comprehension skills. As these youngsters complete their reading aptitude sheets, your one-on-one help will open a new chapter of renewed excitement about learning. You\u2019ll take home memories of sharing something special from the heart and you can feel free to donate a favorite new or gently used book to the school\u2019s library for the children to enjoy time and time again."}
