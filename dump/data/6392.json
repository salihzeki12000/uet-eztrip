We'll start out with a visit to the Punta Laguna Monkey Reserve, a sanctuary for howler monkeys and spider monkeys.  See the monkeys in their natural habitat, screeching and swinging from the treetops.  A real treat for any visitor to the tropical rain forest!  We'll ride a zip line over a crystal-clear laguna, then canoe back before ending with a Mayan ceremony made by a shaman of the community.  Then we'll cool off with a rappel and swim in a sacred Mayan cenote.\n\nAfter a delicious Mayan lunch in a local restaurant near Coba lake, we'll tour the Coba Mayan Ruins, the largest of the Mayan cities of the Yucatan, not yet fully excavated.  We'll rent bicycles and ride through the jungle to the spectacular Nohoch-Mul. Here you'll have opportunity to climb the great pyramid, where you will be treated to vast vistas of rain forest with the Caribbean Sea beyond."}
