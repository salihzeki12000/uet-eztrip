It is not because they don't like you but because they have their own friends and own habits. It takes sometimes to reach them.\u00a0I am part of the local and it is a plus for you if you want to see what it is to be part of the danish culture.\u00a0My boyfriend is a musician so he knows places where you can here for free or really cheap concerts.There are social, art and food events in the city that I know from friends to friends which as a visitor you will not be aware because it is really local."}
