This unique trek combines the two most popular tourist attractions in the Cusco region.\n\nChoquequirao is often thought of as the Incan \"Sister City\" of Machu Picchu. This ancient site is also settled deep in the beautiful Andes mountains and it is larger than Machu Picchu, meaning that you will have more ruins to explore. This local secret is also much less crowded than the famous Machu Picchu, making for a more peacful visit.\n\nThis Trek takes you through sub-tropical rainforests and high mountain passes, giving you incredible views of the diverse landscape. On several occasions, our groups have even spotted the rare Andean Spectacled Bear, the only species of bear native to South America."}
