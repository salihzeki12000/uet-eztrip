This area is also characterised by the production of textiles, using techniques and tools inherited from ancestral times; a good example of living culture.\nOn our trek we will walk though altitude levels such as Quechua, Suni and Puna, with the highest altitude we reach being 4600 masl.\n\nThe geography is spectacular and we will have the opportunity to get to know the flora and fauna characteristic of each of the ecological levels mentioned above."}
