Not a city local, a rural local? Waking up early in the morning going to the paddy field, ploughing with the buffalo, feeding pigs, chicken, harvesting corn, beans...What else can you think of? A farmer work as hard as any office worker, maybe harder, to instead of working 9 to 5, how about from 5 - 9 ( I'm only kidding, or am I.....) \n\nHow about learning how to cook with...wood? So what is in the local market, what else is inside the local home? Going back to the museum but in real life... The time machines start ticking.... \n\nNotice: I am currently NOT in Vietnam, so all communication  please via Triip messages or my personal email at hoaqle311@gmail.com (questions or special requests before booking are welcome, even just asking for information and assistant, I will gladly help in anyway I can). Thank you in advanced."}
