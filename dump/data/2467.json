After a two- and half an hour drive, a boat takes you to the Cai Be floating market with sellers and buyers bargaining and exchanging goods from their boats, and then to Binh Hoa Phuoc Islet where the maze of shady creeks will surely fascinate you. You will have a chance to mingle with local peasants, learn the secrets of their bonsai gardening and take a look at local products. A typical Vietnamese lunch at a local home will be arranged."}
