As we search for these magnificent creatures, we will look for dense congregations of marine life near the surface of the water, feeding on the groups of sardines that are pushed to the surface by the sailfish.\n\nOnce in the water, you will appreciate the incredible hunting tactics of the sailfish - changing color and raising their fins to attack the sardines, hitting them quickly with their bills and then swallowing them whole.  It is a magnificent natural scene, and you will feel so lucky for having the rare opportunity to witness this spectacle up close.  This is an experience you will never forget."}
