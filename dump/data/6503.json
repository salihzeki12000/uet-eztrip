The town\u2019s proximity to the Bay of Banderas, the agricultural valley of the Ameca River, and the important mining centers in the Sierra have given it a more complex and geographically and culturally rich past than most Mexican tourist spots.  Understanding the history, art and natural wonders of Puerto Vallarta will give your visit depth, understanding of its culture and idiosyncrasy."}
