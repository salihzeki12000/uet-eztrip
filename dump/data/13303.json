If you don't like beer, that is okay, because these places also have great food! We all love food, right? I will be taking you to three breweries in Kern County: Lenthwise Brewing Company, Temblor Brewing, and then if you're up for a little drive, I would take you up to Kernville by Lake Isabella to visit the Kern River Brewing Company. All of these places offer creative food options and extremely delicious beer."}
