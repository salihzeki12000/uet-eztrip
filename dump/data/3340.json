Each member is a martial arts expert, possessing championship level of Taekwondo and gymnastic skills. They enjoy nothing more than challenging each other to martial arts showdowns, displaying their awe-inspiring expertise. The plot thickens when two burglars break into the family home in the middle of the night - one a sleek, mean villain, the other a plump, bumbling idiot - complete with rather scary hair! When the family discovers the intruders, a mighty battle ensues. What follows is an incredible display of acrobatic and martial arts skills, with a healthy dose of slapstick humor."}
