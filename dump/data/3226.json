Nanta has been a sell-out success at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival in the UK and was also the first long-running Korean show on Broadway in New York City. The shows have been so successful that they now run at three exclusive theaters in Seoul which are equipped with special lighting and sound systems to create maximum audience impact."}
