Home to the world-famous coffee, this soaring landscape offers panoramic views of mist covered peaks and pristine, emerald valleys. Learn about the indigenous herbs and plants that seem to grow everywhere you look; see coffee plantations, with their bean-clad plants clinging to the mountainsides. Take a cool dip under a crystal clear waterfall, and bask in the clear mountain air as you feast on delicious Jamaican brunch."}
