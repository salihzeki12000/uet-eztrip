An architect (whacky glasses and aluminium briefcase optional) will act as your guide to explain how competition between the titanic egos of internationally-famed architects is shaping a unique district. This tour takes in some of the areas subject to the most ambitious redevelopment Barcelona has seen in recent years \u2013Poble Nou and the Diagonal Mar area. We\u2019ll be looking at some prestigious, award-winning projects (including the Torre Agbar, Design Museum, the F\u00f2rum building) by world-renowned architects (Jean Nouvel, David Chipperfield, Oriol Bohigas, etc.) considering them both on their own merits and their impact, individual and collective, on the surrounding area.  Aspects looked at will include smart design, planning issues and sustainability (e.g. how a nitrogen capsule contributes to insulating a building)."}
