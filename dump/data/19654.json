The My Son Sanctuary is an\nexceptional example of cultural interchange, with an indigenous society\nadapting to external cultural influences, notably the Hindu art and\narchitecture of the Indian sub-continent. It presents a vivid picture of\nspiritual and political life in an important phase of the history of South-East\nAsia."}
