We pass through the Chinchero high mesa toward Lake Piuray. The communities of farmers located along the Piuray lake shore are excellent examples of true Andean traditional living. This well preserved Inca trail takes you to the Inca palace of Huchuyqosqo, from where you will have amazing views of the Sacred Valley and surrounding mountain ranges. The second day in the afternoon take the train to Machu Picchu town for an overnight. The next day we will visit the long awaited magical Sanctuary of Machu Picchu and back to Cusco."}
