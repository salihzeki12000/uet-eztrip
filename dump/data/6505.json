We could say that Spanish people elevate gastronomy to an art form, almost a religion, and enjoy every bite to the fullest!\nSpain is a diverse country with incredibly rich and varying gastronomy. You only have to visit regions like Andaluc\u00eda, Galicia, Basque Country or Valencia to understand we are talking about. Fortunately Madrid offers visitors a real mosaic of the Spanish cuisine, integrating all the regions, in large part thanks to the hundreds of thousands of immigrants from other Spanish provinces who came to Madrid and opened theirs bars and restaurants."}
