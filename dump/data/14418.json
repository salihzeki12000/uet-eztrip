We'll start off in Waterfront Station where we will take the SeaBus to North Vancouver and visit Lonsdale Quay Market. Next, we'll take the SkyTrain to Chinatown, where we will learn about the city's immigrant history as well as sample its unique architecture and shops. Finally, we will visit Gastown and take in the sights of Vancouver's oldest neighbourhood and enjoy a cup of coffee or pint of beer."}
