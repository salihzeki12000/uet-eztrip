Then we will walk around Sword Lake and discover its own beauty. Trang Tien Ice Cream restaurant, which has become one of the greatest Hanoi cuisines, shall be the next destination. The very unique thing of Trang Tien ice cream from other ice-cream stores in Hanoi is that people have to queue for purchasing an ice cream at the stall because the ice-cream is so great. Last but not least, we will visit Hanoi Opera House, which is an architecture for art performing, located on the August Revolution Square, at the top of Trang Tien Street, not very far from Sword Lake and the Museum of Vietnamese History."}
