First, tropical fruit trees such as Mangosteen, Durian, Rambutan, Langsat, Green Siamese Coconut, and the Date-palm were brought in by father Gernot from Thailand and Malaysia through the Cambodia gateway. These trees after that multiplied in the gardens of influential rich men, who also served in the local council. So, amongst the first Vietnamese in Cho Lach to grow the imported trees known to many were the brothers of Nguyen Van Hieu (a councilman, who was born here in 1883) and Nguyen Van Thuan (a foreman, born 1887, died 1975). Both were living in Cai Mon, Cho Lach District"}
