The Rio de Janeiro for many years was the country's capital and one of the cities with the highest import of slaves from Africa\u00a0.\u00a0So\u00a0today we have an experience at the center the Rio de Janeiro City where we will\u00a0focus\u00a0on where was the slave market and where was the stronghold of them during this time. But contrary to what one might think, the\u00a0triip\u00a0will not be focused on sorrow and grief\u00a0,\u00a0but in places where black culture was born and strengthened\u00a0.\u00a0We will have incredible views of the city and learn about some typical restaurants of cariocan\u00a0food.And the most interesting\u00a0thing is : NO NEED FOR TICKETS.You will only pay for what you eat or drink."}
