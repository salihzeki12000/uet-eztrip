There are many things to admire,\u00a0from the Chocolate Hills, to the Tarsier (a nocturnal primate), \u00a0from the Loboc River and its floating restaurant to Tagbilaran City itself. Add to these stunning\u00a0palm fringed coastlines that are blessed with a myriad of white sand beaches and sheltering coves,\u00a0 and of course, the ever smiling, ever friendly Boholano people!"}
