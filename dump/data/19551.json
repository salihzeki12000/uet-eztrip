Almost right away we are away from the\nbusy roads and on to quiet hard pack single track lanes. After a while we will\ntake a well-earned break and stop at a very local shop for some delicious Pho\nand an energizing cup of local Vietnamese coffee before carrying on into\nevermore rural regions where the trail becomes flanked by fishponds as the main\nincome generator in these parts and mangrove swamps. we press on \u00a0over local ferry crossings, through villages, over\nstreams, skirting canals saying hello to the friendly residents as we pass by."}
