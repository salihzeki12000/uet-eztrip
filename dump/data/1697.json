A weekends centered on nature tripping, exploring and enjoying the place.\n\nIt's a highly individualistic activity, great for people with passions like sightseeing, hiking, mountain climbing, camping, swimming and so on. However its also a great way for people who generally avoid extended time in nature to reconnect with themselves in the natural setting. Often the humbling experience of hiking up a mountain or the serenity of a tranquil forest afford the perfect setting to leave behind stress and regroup in an effective, healthy manner.\n\nTying memories to places through communing with nature creates rewarding, positive experiences that will work against the stress cycle.\n\nJoin me for a weekend of extreme activities. Let's go hiking, camping, cave exploration, swimming and more!"}
