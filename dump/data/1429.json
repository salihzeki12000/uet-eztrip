Accessible by a steep \n10-minute climb, the crystal-clear waters of Lake Kayangan are nestled \ninto the mountain walls; underwater is like a moonscape. There's a \nlittle wooden walkway and platform to stash your things if you go for a \nswim. Kayangan Lake won the cleanest lake/hall of fame award in the \nPhilippines."}
