I would like to say that it is highly popular because of its memorable scenic view and its honest-to-goodness organic rappelling experience. This is one of the most photogenic mountains I have ever climbed. It is advisable for beginners. Photo-enthusiasts and adventure-seeking nomads are encouraged. People with vertigo are discouraged though."}
