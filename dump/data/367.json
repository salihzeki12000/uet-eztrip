Unlike the city center, Cho Lon keeps it original bustling atmosphere with narrow street and tons of motorbikes hustling all the time. Don't be scared, I will be with you all the time :D. Among the fast pace of modernization, there are still precious gems remain inact after the heavy bombing of Vietnam war such as Thien Hau pagoda and Binh Tay market. If you want to escape the city center and enjoy the real dynamic Saigon, this is the tour you cannot miss - the most in depth tour in Cho Lon, the biggest China town in Vietnam!"}
