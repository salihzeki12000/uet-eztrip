Its shores and islands, such as Amantani and Taquile, are home to the Aymaras and Quechuas, who are amongst Peru's oldest peoples, predating the Incas by a thousand years. Here visitors may wander through old traditional villages where Spanish is a second language and where ancient myths and beliefs still hold true. Our program also includes the visit to the famous Uros Floating Islands. Our tour is led by a local guide who will introduce you its inhabitants and will explain about their history and traditions. Here we will take a nice ride on their little handmade reed boats around the floating villages."}
