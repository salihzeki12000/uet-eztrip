A complete novice? No problem! Of course, for more advanced dancers, we can organize something more daring as well.  All these classes are available for very small to much larger groups and can be organized at different venues.\nAnd, if you first fancy combining your class with a traditional  meal at an amazing spot high up on Tibidabo, we can do this for larger groups. This will give you the calories you need for that unaccustomed exercise, and the alcohol-fuelled lack of inhibition so you don\u2019t care about making a complete fool of yourself. Perfect! Just make sure that someone brings a camera so that your humiliation will live on forever on the interwebz."}
