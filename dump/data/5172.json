The second day will be the longest day of the tour, and while you work a bit harder to get there, the views at the top are even more rewarding. The walk to reach the famous Apacheta Pass at 4,600m/15,088ft) (the Inca Trail's 'Dead Woman\u2019s Pass' is only 4,200m/13,776ft)) is not strenuous neither very steep, afterward it is mainly descent into a more tropical area passing Andenes and Chaullay on the far side of the mountain.  We`ll take the forty five minute train ride from the famous Hydro Electric Dam and then spend the rest of the 4th evening relaxing in the town and hotsprings of Aguas Calientes.  Early in the morning you take the bus (or walk if desired) up to Machu Picchu for your guided tour, a well deserved reward but many say the trek is a prize in itself!"}
