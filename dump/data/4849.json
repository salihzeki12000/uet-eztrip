This remote and rarely visited region offers the trekker an insight into  the real lives of Andean farmers, dressed in their traditional brightly-colored  ponchos. You will have the opportunity to see thatched stone houses surrounded  by herds of llamas and alpacas. Inside the houses\u2019 kitchens, you\u2019ll see guinea  pigs running loose. The trek itself is about as difficult as the Inca Trail.  There are, however, two passes over 13,000 feet (4,000 meters), so it is  essential that you are well acclimatized to the altitude before beginning the  trek. If you are arriving from sea level, plan on spending at least 3 days in  Cusco and the surrounding area before undertaking the trek."}
