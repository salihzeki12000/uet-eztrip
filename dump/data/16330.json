This trip is great for the fall when the leaves are changing or in mid spring after the buds have opened. Don't be too concerned about the weather, however, there is plenty to do indoor or out. There are hiking trails with picturesque scenery, and a great attraction to visit inside the house. Whether you want to make it a romantic getaway and relax in the spa with massages and facial treatments, or enjoy a golf outing, or even bring the kids up for some play time, you'll find it all on this trip with many options for any variations of this."}
