We are offering you an\nalternative: breathe fresh air, and connect with nature without leaving the\nmetropolitan area. We will trek in a beautiful nature reserve, enjoy the\nabundance of the rainforest, and swim (if you\u00b4re brave enough) in a crystal\nclear water of the mountain creek pond, looking up a 50m high waterfall. There\nwill be a fair amount of walking, climbing and enjoying the peace and silence\nof nature."}
