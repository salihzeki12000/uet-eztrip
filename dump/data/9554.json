It was the Brazil's first asylum, Hospital Pedro II, created in 1852, that worked until 1944, when it becomes the university. Besides that, the whole campus has little tresures to be explored, like an arena theater. Next to the campus, we can find a very local place called \"Mureta da Urca\", where the locals go to watch a beautiful sunset and have some Original beer sitting on the wall."}
