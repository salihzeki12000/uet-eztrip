On the one side, you'll find these old Chinese temples, markets and busy streets; while on the other side, you will be watching the high rise modern buildings combining into the famous skyline along the Victoria harbour. If you are interested in exploring both sides of Hong Kong, this is the trip for you. It not only covers all the sites mentioned above, but also bringing the local flavours along the way, including local street food, shopping spots, photo-taking sites and more!"}
