You will pass by beautiful views of glaciers into the high jungle close to Machu Picchu. The following days you will be hiking by local villages that grow coca leaves, corn, coffee beans, bananas trees, avocados and other tropical fruits along the slopes of the mountains. Stopping off at the fabulous hot springs at Cocalmayo near the second hostel at Santa Teresa, we keep hiking along the bank of the Urubamba River to catch a glimpse of Machu Picchu from the bottom. On the last day, you will walk through the Seventh Wonder of the World with a two-hour guided tour during which you will learnmuch more about Incan culture and history."}
