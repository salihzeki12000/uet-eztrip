The Lares trek route transverses farms and ancient townships for a fascinating insight into authentic Quechua culture.(Quechua (qheshwa) is an indigenous language of the Andean region. You are likely to meet Andean children and local people, in abundantly coloured traditional dress; as well as a range of wildlife as Llama, Alpaca, andean goose and the affable Andean sheep. A unique hike to get in touch with Andean people and learn about their traditions and life-style."}
