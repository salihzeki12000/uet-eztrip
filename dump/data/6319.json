This exciting ATV tour will take you deep into the jungles of Playa del Carmen to a hidden underground river system and series of amazing limestone caverns with stalactites and stalagmites that will make your jaw drop.\n\nPass through the backroads of Playa del Carmen on your way to a series of dirt roads and remote jungle paths, where we'll blaze the hilly trails of the Riviera Maya on our ATVs.  Arriving at the secret cenote (Mayan Cave) of Shil'o, we'll learn about the unique geology of these caves, and how they got to be so amazing.  We'll use helmets and flashlights to discover the treasures that these cenotes hold, as we trek underground from one cave to the next.  After a refreshing swim in the cool fresh water, we'll hop back on the ATVs for a rip-roaring good ride back home."}
