We'll evite the main \"touristic area\" of Saint Michel and we'll reach less touristic places. As a person that's been living in this quarter and that loves degustations, I'll show you the best places to eat and to drink. I'll add to this a bit of sightseeing (Panth\u00e9on, Notre Dame, City Hall) and cultural tips (best cinemas, galleries)."}
