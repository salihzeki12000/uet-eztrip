A triple-threat experience that combines three encounters in one, this amazing tour invites you to ride the Rainforest Sky Explorer, a state-of-the-art chair lift that soars 700 feet above the tree tops, transporting you high above Ocho Rios. Next up, you can hop aboard Bobsled Jamaica, a high-tech, custom-designed bobsled that speeds you along stainless steel rails on a 1,000-meter, gravity-driven thrill ride through the forest. Finally your journey ends with a rainforest Zipline Canopy traverse that sends you whizzing across a tensile cable strung between a series of tree-to-tree platforms arrayed across a lush, tropical forest."}
