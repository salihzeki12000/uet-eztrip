It's only\u00a0about 100km east of Tokyo and 27km east of Narita Airport.\u00a0Sawara streets remain much as they were 200 years ago in the\u00a0Edo\u00a0Period.\u00a0It was very important town for military and economy. In addition, the area has been designated as a national preservation district due to several remaining historic buildings. I love this place so much and would like to share the wonderful time with you. Let's experience the Little-Edo town together!"}
