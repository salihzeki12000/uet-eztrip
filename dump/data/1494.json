Their appeal and charm have always been attractive; no matter, whether to the kids or the grown-ups.\n\nThe Mandovi Bay in Goa is one of the most suitable and fertile places for the dolphins. Every morning, families or pods of playful dolphins swarm the Mandovi Bay, creating a magnificent and stunning outlook around the bay. These dolphins visit the bay in search of food or to swim at leisure; at times, large number of dolphin families can also be seen in the bay.\n\nThis tour will take the visitors to the Mandovi Bay and will offer them some of the best memories with the dolphins. Alongside spotting the amazing dolphins, the visitors can also go for swimming on the tranquil water of Coco Bay; lunch on board will add more charm to the tour."}
