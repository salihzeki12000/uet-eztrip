Spanish officials forced the Chinese to convert into Catholicism and if not they'd be executed. Luis P\u00e9rez Dasmari\u00f1as played a prominent role in the massacre of 24,000 Chinese after the Chinese revolt in 1603. The reason for the massacre was that he wanted to avenge his father's death under the hand of the Sangleys. Binondo's population grew rapidly with many Chinese Mestizos, products of intermarriage between the now-Catholic Chinese and local Filipinos. The district is therefore known as the birthplace of the Chinese Mestizos, including St. Lorenzo Ruiz, who became the first Filipino saint, and Mother Ignacia del Espiritu Santo, a Mestiza de Sangley who was the founder of the congregation of the Religious of the Virgin Mary.\n\n-wikitravel"}
