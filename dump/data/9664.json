Though nature is in constant movement, it is also the place to find great stillness. You find who you are, your source,\u00a0in\u00a0the stillness of the present moment with nature moving through you. While you do not need to go anywhere or do anything to find this since it is inside of you, nature serves to quiet the mind, open a window to the soul\u00a0and reveal you to you."}
