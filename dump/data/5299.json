The ships\u2019 activities inspired the name V\u0169ng T\u00e0u, which means \u201canchorage\u201d. The Portuguese navigators passed V\u0169ng T\u00e0u many times and named it after Saint Jacques(disambiguation needed). The French invaded Vietnam afterwards and called it Cape Saint Jacques. The cliff of V\u0169ng T\u00e0u is now called M\u0169i Nghinh Phong (literally meaning \u201cCape of breeze welcome\u201d)."}
