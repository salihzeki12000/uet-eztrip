I can easily reach it by walking 5 minutes far from my home and as soon as I enter from the main gate, I feel immediately better, more relaxed, calm, happy. I hope to transmit you the same emotions \u00a0I feel by making you walking around and breathing the magic atmosphere of this temple of the Music but also or this shining set of the CineFestival with its celebrities or this austere siege of the most important cultural and scientific festivals gathering the most outstanding lecturers from all over the world."}
