Under the crystalline waters you will encounter multi-colored tropical fish, rays, eels, sea turtles, soft corals and urchins. On land the wildlife is equally abundant. The islands offer sanctuary for a great number of sea birds, among which are: cormorants, frigates, brown boobies and the ever-graceful blue-footed boobies. These islands really offer the best conditions in the bay."}
