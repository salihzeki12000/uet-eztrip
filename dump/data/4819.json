The drive towards the South Coast of Jamaica is an adventure in itself taking you through the hills and winding roads to explore what the South has to offer.\n\nOur adventure tour starts off with a visit to the safari where you are up close and personal with crocodiles, then you are transported to a beautiful waterfall that has ziplines for you to soar from the trees, then an adventure out to one of a kind bar located in the middle of the ocean!"}
