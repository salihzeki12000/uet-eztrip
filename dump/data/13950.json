(We can either meet at S. Sebasti\u00e3o metro station or on top of Parque Eduardo VII). From there, we\u00b4re going to walk downhill through one of the most famous streets of Lisbon into the lower part of Lisbon, known as the \"Baixa\". From there we continue on to the Miradouro de Sta. Justa, which also has a beautiful view. After this we go visit the castle of Lisbon. To end the trip we go to the Terreiro do Pa\u00e7o, one of the most famous squares of Lisbon, and walk a bit along the river. From there I can give you some tips on what you could do next."}
