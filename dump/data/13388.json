But this is the actual neighbourhood where Plato's Academy was. The real people's neighbourhood in the 21st century. Surrounded by other places such as Sepolia and Kolonos, we are gonna follow the route that leads to the Academy and the places around it, stumbling on the way on parks, churches, current art projects and just breathing the same air where all these great thoughts took place ages ago."}
