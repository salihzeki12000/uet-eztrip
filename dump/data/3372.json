For most visitors, the sight, smell and sound of the wet markets are quite an eye-opener. Here, you can mingle with the locals and see how day-to-day activities are carried out, minus any \"staged\" performance that might be organized by other tour operators.\n\nBefore I started this tour, I got many requests from my existing students. Most of them would ask me questions like. \"Where to get the best ingredients?\" or \"Where to shop for local cooking utensils?\".\n\nAt the local wet markets, quipped my late grandmother, \"You can buy almost everything, except your own mother\". Thus, this special Penang Market Tour was born since November 2010 together with my cooking class in George Town."}
