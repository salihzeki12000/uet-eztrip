But the extreme hidden beauty of those places make them an obligation if you want to really discover and explore the best spots in our city.Once you arrive at those places, you will feel a big sense of privacy and freedom. It is hard to believe that in a big urban area like Rio, you can find beaches untouched by man. You think you are in some island or small ocean city, but this is the mix what makes Rio unique.Coming with me, you find a reasonable price to go to amazing spots that even some people who live here never have been to. I have a nice camera, chairs, ball, rackets, everything you will need at the beach. Also, I will give to you a good knowledge about what you really should know about Rio, from a perspective of a true local and I will make a lot of effort to make your triip unforgettable."}
