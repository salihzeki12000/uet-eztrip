The name is due to its unique rocky, rugged and cut shape coastline, composed of small coves surrounded by pine forests and lapped by crystal water. \n \nIts natural wealth and beauty is apparent in several territories and protected areas, such us Cap de Creus, the Emporda Marshes and the Marine Reserve Medes islands. \n \nThe fame of Costa Brava is also due to its villages. Small fisherman towns, with whitewashed walls and narrow winding streets, today still retain their charm. This area has historically been a point of entry, transit, and settlement for different cultures and civilizations. Each has left its footprints, which is evidenced by the Greek and Roman sites in Empuries. \n \nOur intention is to show in one day the most representative and emblematic sites along the northeastern shores of Catalunya, places of unsurpassable beauty that will give you a taste of all this area has to offer. The Costa Brava is not to be missed!"}
