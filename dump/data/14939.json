Follow me through Bordeaux and you will see. This tour is about emperors, kings, queens, rebellions, revolutions, wars, merchants, slaves, religions and ... wine! Nothing less than a Game of Thrones! The three hours walk through the ancient and modern city will make you understand how trade is always in the background of history and how some people, because they are very special, change the destiny of a city. I will show you how to \"read\" this city and how it actually connects to the story and history of your own place."}
