There is a playground in the fresh air with spectacular views, situated on the way up to a local farm with animals, a vineyard, and seasonably a taste of fresh local produce. :) Then a little further up, there is a castle with gardens to explore and a caf\u00e9. You can also hike or bike if you like. Depending on the weather and your preferences, you could spend a couple hours, an afternoon, or a day here. It is a simple, special and beautiful place to get away to. There are thoughtfully placed benches in the gardens in case you would like to meditate, read, write, draw.... Any part of any of our tours may be selected or combined for special celebrations as well - just mail amyluzern@gmail.com or 2billionmoms@gmail.com. Depending on the length of your visit, day trips may be designed to suit your interests. Just send us a mail with questions or requests. Lucerne is one of the most beautiful cities in Switzerland and is a romantic place for honeymooners. Playgrounds abound in natural settings around the area as well. We look forward to meeting you! :)"}
