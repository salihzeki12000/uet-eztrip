I will invite participants to visit places that even the Jakarta people itself was not much to know. Places that are rich in culture, art and history, a place away from the crowds with an atmosphere that does not feel like being in Jakarta which usually always busy and full of pollution. Something other than a tour of the city that are usually only invites participants to the places that is always the same. I probably would invite participants to use local transportation such as angkot (public transportation), ojek (motorbike taxi), or bajaj (three-wheeler). So be prepared to have the experience like the local people."}
