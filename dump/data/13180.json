It is one of the oldest commercial districts in North America and is minutes away from the St. John's Harbour and the Atlantic Ocean. We will see everything from art both serious and light-hearted, friendly pubs and austere banks, oyster bars and hot dog carts. And maybe even an iceberg. There will be a little history, a little sight-seeing, a little walking. This triip is perfect for people who want to get the feel of a city without the feel of a lecture. The groups will be small and the vibe relaxed."}
