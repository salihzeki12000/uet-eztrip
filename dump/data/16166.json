While Waitan and French concession are well-known to tourists as some of Shanghai's landmark, Hongkou area which used to be a Japanese Concession is not very well promoted tourist destination. Nevertheless, there are rich history and preserved historical sites that calls to be visited including the Luxun Park, Jewish Memorial Museum, 1933 Laochangfang, etc. Although not within the central business district, the region is lively with international students studying in four top universities in Shanghai including Fudan and Tongji Univ."}
