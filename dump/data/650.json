This tour is designed to introduce you the dishes and desserts that are completely unique, lesser known - only local people love to eat and most other tours don't really touch upon! You are unlimited to eat local Vietnamese cuisine from the North, Central and South Vietnam. \n\nOne of the best ways to tour around Ho Chi Minh city using motorbike. You are maybe scared of traffic jam here but when you go on this tour you realise that they all operate under some set of principles which is why there aren't too many accidents. Throughout the night we are going to visit 5 places, you will see the major sites of Saigon while feel some fresh air. It is a truly amazing experience than ever!\n\nAuthentic Vietnamese food, fanstatis driving experience, culture & historical knowledge, great hanging out time and a lot of funs. Let join with me, the real local expert!"}
