Whether its shopping, dining, cocktail bars, live music, a guided walk, or a trek off the beaten path- I'd love to show you the city I've known for 10+ years. Through conversation, we can discuss what you'd like get out of your time in NYC. \u00a0As a natural explorer, history and art lover, and independent soul, I have ventured off the beaten paths and discovered a city with every kind of charm. When you visit, you will see and experience the city of your choice. The traveler has preferences, the guide makes the itinerary. That experience starts here!"}
