It's not often that you get to experience a sub culture and party like locals, but that's what this trip is all about. Gqom\n is a style of dance music that originates in Durban, and is taking the \nworld by storm. This experience allows you to meet and hang out with the\n orginal gqom crews, in an area of Durban you would never get into \nyourself."}
