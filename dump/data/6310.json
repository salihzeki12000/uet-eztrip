This brand new excursion in Playa del Carmen will take you over to Cozumel Island, where you will visit the one and only Stingray Beach.  Here, in the clear blue waters of Cozumel, you will get to hold, touch and even feed real live stingrays! Breathe easy, their barbs have been removed so it's totally safe, and oh so fun!  Feel their \"Hoover-like\" mouths on your hands, it's really exciting!\n\nAfter your stingray encounter, you can go snorkeling with the stingrays and of course lots of beautiful tropical fish too!  Watch the resident critters provide additional entertainment while relaxing at the beach club for the rest of the day.  The beach club features a water trampoline for the kids, and tables, umbrellas, chairs, shops, and restrooms.  End your day by exploring downtown Cozumel with or without your guide.  Where else can you do this?"}
