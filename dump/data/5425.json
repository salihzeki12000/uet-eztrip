Despite being extremely touristic, it's still an excellent tour that gets you out of Cusco city and helps you begin to understand the incredible construction and building abilities of the Incas. You will be amazed by the enormous, towering rocks at Sacsayhuaman and the views of Cusco. This is a great day's outing that can be done on horseback, on foot, or by car, depending on your fitness."}
