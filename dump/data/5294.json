Any struggle for independence or maintaining of the status quo is not really a struggle for \u201cfreedom\u201d, but a struggle for power. One side wants to stay in control of that power and another side wants to put them out so they can have it. But everything is changing after 35 years liberation. This is the best time to visit when the city both keep the original architecture and development."}
