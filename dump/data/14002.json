I became a professional photographer in 2008, and have spent several years documenting this city and sharing my passion for photography with everyone I meet.\u00a0The museums and monuments are great, but what really makes this city special to me is the art, culture and people that's made by people here. So often, visitors don't get to see all the beauty D.C. really has to offer. I'm here to give you that opportunity, and help you gain some photo skills along the way.\u00a0All you need is a camera, and for this, even your cell phone can count! No matter what your skill level... if you're an experienced pro, dedicated hobbyist, instagram addict or total newbie to photography who's just trying to take better vacation photos, I'll work with you to make sure you have a great time and create amazing photos along the way."}
