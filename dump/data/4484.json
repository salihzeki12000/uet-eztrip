No one wants 100\u2032s of drunken rowdy tourists taking over their favorite bars. It is a bit offensive and just not Berlin-style.\n\nThe Alternative night tour is a much more low key, calmer affair taking you to underground spots hidden away from the tourist hordes.\n\nIn smaller groups and with the right attitude you can visit some of the city\u2019s most amazing spots and actually meet some of the locals. This is what our alternative pubcrawl is all about."}
