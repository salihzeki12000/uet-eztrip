A cross between windsurfing, wakeboarding and paragliding, kite boarding delivers a real thrill to those who master the sport.  Once you learn to keep the kite airborne, you'll speed across the water at a high rate of speed - very exciting!  With practice, you may even be able to do high-flying aerial acrobatics, actually sailing through the air doing spins and tricks, high out of the water.\n\nOur expert staff offers you the opportunity of a lifetime - to learn kite boarding on the beautiful white sand beaches of Tulum, and its warm blue-green waters.  We offer lessons to all skill levels of riders - from beginner to expert - and different time frames to suit various levels of interest and budgets.  To really get flying, we recommend a 12 hour course over 3 days, but for those with less time we offer a 6 hour course over 2 days (we recommend at least 6 hours to really get to enjoy yourself for first-timers), a 4 hour one-day course, and a series of 2 hour courses."}
