My favorite is that we have several bridges to commute across the River Tyne to get a spectacular view of the city walk and surrounding buildings. We start at the famous Grey's monument and walk through the streets to see the famous old architecture of the United Kingdom. Then we make our way across either the Tyne Bridge or the High Level Bridge (at your choice.) From here is where you will get the views of the landmark Millennium bridge and rivercoast. Depending on the bridge of your choice, you can see the other. (If you're on the Tyne, you can see the High Level, and so on. ((You can't see the Millenium from the High Level.)) After we walk along the river and past the local cafe's and pubs, ending the tour in a lively social hub area of Newcastle called Quayside."}
