It is too bad because Indonesia tea is actually highly consumed in the world, with some loyal customers such as Queen Elizabeth II and Dutch Royal Family. If you now feel curious about the famous Indonesia tea, why don't you come and experience it by yourself? About 1 hour from Jakarta, there is a place called Gunung Mas (literally means Golden Mountain). This place is famous for its tea plantation, with lush green tea hills and fresh air. This is the most famous gateway for Jakarta people from the crowded city to the serene countryside."}
