Stretching over 50 miles, the full extent of the Dos Ojos system is yet to be discovered.  Dos Ojos (two eyes) is named after a pair of cenotes that connect into a giant underground cavern, an awesome effect that makes Dos Ojos one of the best known cenotes near Playa del Carmen for snorkeling and scuba diving."}
