This tour offers both physical activity and the unique opportunity to observe a way of life that has changed little over the centuries. As we ride in Mai Chau we encounter Muong and White Thai minorities and are guests in their traditional stilt-houses allowing us to see firsthand how these minority peoples live.. After a day or remote cycling you will be rewarded and spoilt with dinner and a night at the lovely Mai Chau Lodge. The next day the rewards continue with a mostly downhill ride before transferring back to Hanoi."}
