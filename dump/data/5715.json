This area is home of two American camels, the Vicu\u00f1as and Guanacos, which can be seen running freely through the Andean plateau. Unlike their cousins the Llamas and Alpacas, the Vicu\u00f1as and Guanacos are wild animals, they have not been domesticated and have adapted to high altitudes where drought and freezing nights are the natural rules. The Vicu\u00f1a Reserve of Pampas Galeras houses roughly 70% of vicu\u00f1as in the world, therefore a tour to Pampas Galeras guarantee any visitor a good experience with these wonderful Andean camels."}
