By taking this excursion visitors will really get off the beating track, avoiding less crowded environments and will enjoy along the way wonderful landscapes and fine Inca buildings. Without a doubt the trek of Salkantay is the best alternative to reach the great Sanctuary of Machu Picchu, after the famous Inka Trail. Walk back in time and feel the magic of Machu Picchu exploring its temples and don't leave Machu Picchu without climbing the popular Wayna Picchu Mountain, a gigantic rock that appears in every classic photo of Machu Picchu."}
