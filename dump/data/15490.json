In my proposed itinerary, if you only have 1 or 2 days in Danang city, there are some special places where you should visit, otherwise it would be almost as if you never visited here. Firstly, we will visit Linh Ung Pagoda, which is the largest pagoda in Da Nang in terms of scale and artistic architecture. The Pagoda is famous for its beautiful 67-metre-tall Goddess of Mercy statute standing on a lotus-shaped platform. Secondly, Ba Na hills, is a must-visit and it would be even better if u could spend a night here. Ba Na Hills is absolutely wonderful, romantic and enjoyable at any time of the day; good food, fresh air, mild weather, an amazing view from the hill peak, an amusement park and cable cars giving you an amazing trip from the ground to its peak (don't worry, it's 100% safe!). Next, we will go sightseeing at My Khe beach, which is one of the most idyllic beaches in Da Nang city. Tourists from all over the world come here for convalescence and relaxation. Last but not least, I will show you the 4 special bridges that make Da Nang city more awesome in the eyes of any travellers. They are especially beautiful when viewed at night because of the unique lights that come along. An at 9pm every Saturday and Sunday, you will even observe a fire-breathing dragon that almost seems as if it came out of a storybook."}
