Of all the whales, the humpbacks\u00a0(Megaptera novaeangliae) are the most spectacular ones thanks to their breaching, lobtailing, flippering and their beautiful songs, which are part of their courtship rituals. Wildlife Connection offers you the opportunity to enjoy an unforgettable encounter with these friendly giants who arrive to Puerto Vallarta to mate and give birth, during the winter months, year after year. We can also enjoy different species of dolphins inside the bay. Come with us and meet these magnificent creatures."}
