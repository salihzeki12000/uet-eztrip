The place is home to the H'Mong and Thai community.\n\nMu Cang Chai is about 1000 meters above sea level, the steep hills make it almost impossible to grow rice fields like those in the delta. Thus local residences grow their own rice on the terraced fields, for the purpose of preventing water from flowing downhill. These terraced fields lying among rugged green moutain valleys, under clear blue sky or a mysterious and crips fog, bring to eyes an imposing scenery. During harvesting season, ready crops transitioned to yellow, while new crops still remain in their green color. The scenery is a big attraction to photographer and trekkers.\n\nThe terraced paddy fields in three rural communes namely La Pan Tan, Che Cu Nha and Ze Xu Phinh are recognized by Government as a National Monument.\n\nBest season to visit is April to middle of May - the water pouring season; September to early October, this is the harvesting season."}
