It starts on a local boat tour taking you upriver to an underground journey 1,500m through the underwater system. \u00a0You are dropped off halfway through the cave and free to make your own way out on foot. The tour ends with a trip to Paradise Cave, first found in 2005, and given its name for its awesome cave entrance and incredible cave formations."}
