The Inca Trail to Machu Picchu is one of the most impressive examples of the approximately 30,000 kilometres (24,854 miles) of roads built by the Incas nearly 500 years ago. Incan roads were built across the deserts, highlands, and jungles stretching from southern Colombia through Peru, Bolivia, Chile, and Argentina. The Inca Trail starts in a typical mountainous Andean climate and finishes in a jungle climate. Along the way, you will find yourself going through cloud forests, Incan tunnels, bridges, and sometimes snow. Hiking this trek is an opportunity to go back in time and experience the Incan path for four days. Remember, the Inca Trail is not only for your feet but also for your mind!"}
