After hotel pick-up, we'll start out by taking a bike tour of the Coba ruins, where your guide will open your eyes to the magnificent Mayan empire.  Then we'll visit a Mayan ceramics workshop, where you can learn to make pottery in the traditional way, just as the local people do.\n\nNext up is dinner by sunset from the second floor of our lagoon-side restaurant, spectacular!  You'll enjoy live music during dinner before witnessing an exciting Mayan show taking place inside a cenote featuring a Mayan ballgame and more!  Quite a different experience from any other tour in Playa del Carmen."}
