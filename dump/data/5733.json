Down at the bottom of the Canyon you can find green oasis full of palm trees and natural springs pools, where visitors are welcome and allowed to camp outdoors. This is a little paradise, where a generous river created by nature, millions of years ago, still flows into agricultural fields of the native people, providing food for the different communities along the Canyon. The views are excellent from anywhere and Condors can be seen almost year around."}
