The forest\nis very vast, so this trip will primarily be set in the municipality\nof Durbuy and La Roche-en-Ardennes. This place is like heaven and\nperfect for many occasions. The mountains are beautiful. The locals\nspeak French, so for most Europeans, it is a unique culture. Ardennes\nis a natural wonder. Fall is the most stunning time of the year\nbecause of all the colours of the leaves. It is also the wild season\nbecause it is easy to spot various animals. If you are not European,\nthen the nature is quite unusual, so it is the perfect place for you.\nHowever, if you come from Canada or the United States, then you will\nbe more tempted by the cultural aspects of Durbuy and La\nRoche-en-Ardennes. The food is of course delicious, and the beer,\nBelgian. How long you stay depends on how far you've come. If you had\na long trip, it is best to spend the night. Many people have a full\nvacation here. Some people even have a summer house in Ardennes."}
