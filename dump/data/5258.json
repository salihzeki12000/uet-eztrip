This trek takes you up and along Salkantay, which is the second largest mountain in the Cusco region (6280 msn).  On the first night, you will sleep not too far away from the snow capped peak.  The second day will be the hardest day of the tour.  While you work a bit harder to get there, the views at the top are even more stellar.  After you reach the 4,600 meter pass, it is almost pure downhill, descending into a more tropical area on the far side of the mountain.  You will take the forty five minute train ride to Aguas Calientes from the famous Hydro ElectricDam and then spend the rest of the 3rd evening relaxing in the town.  In the morning you take the bus up to Machupicchu for your tour."}
