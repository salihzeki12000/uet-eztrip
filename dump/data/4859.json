In this way they established a system of \u201cseq\u2019e\u201d; lines which radiate out from the Qoricancha. These lines were directed towards the cardinal points and their intermediate points. Along these Seqes or lines, places of worship or huacas were built so that rituals and ceremonies could be carried out simultaneously or individually.\nChoqekiraw Puquio is an example of one of these huacas. To the south east of the city of Cusco, this Seqe is represented by a platform supported by semicircular terraces, making an Usnu (ceremonial platform) with a view of Cusco valley."}
