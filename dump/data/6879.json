Rather than just chocolates you would find in a typical chocolate box (truffles, pralines, caramels, fondants), you'll sample the best of chocolate in all its forms: from a freshly roasted cocoa bean to chocolate bars, hot chocolate, gelato, a you-won\u2019t-believe-it\u2019s-dairy-free sorbet, truffles, brownies and a bespoke chocolate cocktail in a secluded London bar."}
