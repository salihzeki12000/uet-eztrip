Makiling is protected by Maria Makiling, a diwata or lambana (a forest nymph or a fairy), therefore making this mountain highly venerated by locals. It was declared an ASEAN Heritage Park in 2013. The Mt Makiling Forest Reserve is a popular destination for day hikers, mountaineers and scientists. Because of its reputation and location (just 2 hours bus ride from Manila), Mt Makiling is well-maintained and boasts of natural scenic view. It also offers a plethora of flora and fauna. It has two trails which are generally accepted as safe."}
