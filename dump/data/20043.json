It is ideal for those people who are interested in craft and artwork and wish to take a unique souvenir of Vietnam home with them. The people of Bat Trang are famous for their ceramics. This is where Hanoians come to buy their pottery. The village of Dong Ho has, for generations, been the place where Vietnam's most famous folk paintings were made. The trip also includes a detour to one of the most remarkable pagodas in North Vietnam called Chua But Thap."}
