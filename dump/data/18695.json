With more than a thousand limestone peaks soaring from its crystalline emerald water this area is one of the natural wonders of Vietnam and now one of four World Heritage listed sites in Vietnam.

The tiny islands are dotted with innumerable beaches and grottoes created by the wind and the waves that make an excellent backdrop for swimming or just lazing about on the boat deck."}
