It was famous for earthenware that was sold in many provinces throughout Central Vietnam. It was Thanh Ha villagers who made the bricks, tiles and floor slabs for the old buildings in Hoi An and the surround-ing areas. Nowadays many old buildings in Hoi An need restoring and the Thanh Ha villag-ers are the only contractors that can pro-vide standardized bricks, tiles and floor slabs exactly like the ones when the old port town prospered.\n\nKIM BONG CARPENTRY VILLAGE\nKim Bong carpentry village is located at Cam Kim Hamlet. This village is very famous for its carpentry, as almost all Hoian ancient architecture were produced by their ancestors' talented hands at a time when Hoi An flourished as a major sea port. Kim Bong carpenters' techniques are perfect. Their sculptured works on the head of scissors, slanting, desks, altars, furniture, cabinets, trays, and the like, are masterpieces admired by everyone. Today, Kim Bong carpenters still keep their old career, although there have been many among them who have shifted to ship building and recovering historical monument or relics. Many products are sold as souvenir to tourists and over-sea."}
