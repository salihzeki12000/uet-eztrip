Visitors will enjoy a cruise on the Mekong River and then ride on a hand-rowed sampan through small inlets under a green canopy of water-coconut trees to catch a glimpse of the daily activities of the local people. A visit to an orchard islet to observe the pastoral life and enjoy coconut milk, seasonal fruit, honey tea and lunch of country delicacies will also be arranged."}
