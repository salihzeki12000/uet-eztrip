The trail is only slightly more difficult than the traditional route, but with amazing sights of the Nevado de Salkantay, the cordillera's tallest peak at 6271m. Salkantay, in the native language, means Savage Mountain, which may refer to the swirling clouds that rise up from the rainforest lowlands and engulf the peak. The mountains of the Cordillera Vilcabamba form a jagged chain between the Urubamba and Apurimac rivers, creating a unique landscape to the area. On the north side of the cordillera, massive snow peaks emerge from lush tropical rain forests."}
