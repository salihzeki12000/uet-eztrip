We'd like to invite you to enjoy the experience of \"ir de tapas\", as madrile\u00f1os do.\nYou will discover hidden spots, even in the very heart of Madrid, each of which has something special to offer, be it a typical dish, a specific type of wine or its atmosphere. Get into the swing of things: go to a bar, enjoy your wine and your free tapa, order something extra to eat if it catches your fancy and, once you\u2019ve finished, move on to the next venue. It\u00b4s as simple as that! Be ready to stand. We do."}
