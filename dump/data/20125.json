Up to now, ha Noi has been one of the few cities in Asia left entirely void of the western- style boxy business architecture. We Hanoi people regard our capital city as heart of Vietnam. Hanoi has always been a sybol of culture and a source of pride througout the history. This tour is designed to give you an opportunity to enjoy an absolute and adorable Hanoi. Small streets with old houses, friendly people with typical Vietnamese offer you true feeling of this capital city."}
