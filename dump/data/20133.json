Minutes after you get out of MTR stations you are already on the way to the mountains. Hong Kong Trail is one of the most friendly trail with extraordinary scene. Many people start from the East, the Dragons' Back, the best urban hiking trail chosen by Time Asia in 2014. It is only a moderate hike to reach the top and you can enjoy the view there. Alternatively for convenience you can also reach the trail from Wan Chai, Central or HKU. If you are up for challenge you can also hike all the 50km and finish at the Victoria Peak! Please talk to me and I can plan a route.\u00a0I love hiking, I do it regularly and would love to introduce the trails and stories behind in my country. The length is flexible. One or two of my friends may also join and we're looking forward to some cultural exchange. Personally I speak English, Chinese, some German/Japanese and learning French :)\u00a0Photo Credit: Lonely Planet"}
