Unfortunately as the city grows, waterways are neglected. Nevertheless, and known by few the city is surprisingly well connected by canals. \n\n\nAs the saying goes \"Life is a journey, not a destination.\" (Ralph Waldo Emerson), I will take you from the West to East of Bangkok by boat. On the way, immerse yourself in the local livelihood. Experience the life of the Bangkok working class."}
