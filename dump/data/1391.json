One of the highlights of any trip to Vietnam is the food. Even if you do not expect to do much Vietnamese cooking, a cooking class is a fun and interesting way to learn about the local ingredients and how to make some popular dishes. In general, most cooking classes are half-day classes starting in the morning with a trip to the local market, followed by a cooking demonstration and lunch where you can eat the dishes that were prepared.\n\nMost of the classes tend to be aimed at casual tourists, rather than serious chefs, and many tend to be cooking demonstrations, rather than classes with individual cooking stations. Please inquire before you book. Also, please keep in mind that some of the smaller, ad-hoc programs may be more flexible to change the menu or require more interaction, especially if you arrange your own private lesson for your group."}
