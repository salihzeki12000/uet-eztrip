In this trek, you will not have to wake up at 3:30 in the morning to stand in line to pass the last checkpoint of the Inca Trail. Instead, we will continue to hike to the entrace on the 3rd day on the Inca Trail which will allow you will visit Machu Picchu twice! The first time you visit Machu Picchu you will arrive just in time to witness the setting sun over the ruins and on next day you will have plenty of time to explore the site. A benefit to visiting Machu Picchu during these times is that you will avoid the peak tourist hours, letting you enjoy this modern wonder of the world in peace and tranquility. You will also have the option of getting a relaxing massage on the evening of the 3rd day and sleeping in a little later and enjoying a trip to the hot springs before your tour of Machu Picchu on the 4th day."}
