Why? Because I love to eat, and Bandung offers me those good foods. Anyone who comes to Bandung always starving for culinary tour. Bandung offers you so much foods: traditional foods in street or in restaurant with a great nature view, traditional food stall that has been cooking its food for more than 50 years or the new innovative menu that has been in business recently. You choose it! Batagor, Lotek, Lumpia Basah, Cireng, Seblak - these menu I mention, are the common menus for the locals. What should you have for desserts? Try having Durian Ice Cream with fermented red rice or Martabak Manis! Where is the restaurant that has been serving since colonial era? Where can I eat while I'm enjoying the green-nature? You should join this tour to find that out....."}
