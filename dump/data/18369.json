Help the traveller to notice the hidden places of Lisbon acording the desires of the travellers.The amazing thing is that this aproach to the City will give a completly perspective of the City, with me as a Butler Guide, respecting the space and time and the privacy of the tourists. It will be as if we are Portuguese citizens having the honour of having a different pleasure, feeling free and away of the Mass Tourism we start to have around downtown Lisbon. Our challenge it will be to underpass this circunstance of running away from the \"tourist eaters\" and at the same time beeing part of them."}
