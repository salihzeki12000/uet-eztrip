Unwind yourself from the hustling day. However, if you think you have seen enough of Ho Chi Minh City, wait until evening hours. Activities really begin to animate during these late hours. This tour is ideal for those who seeks gratifying entertainment in Vietnam\u2019s nightlife. Not only will you be able to go shopping, visit historical landmarks in the evening and enjoy an authentic local dinner, you will also be able to attend the local club and/or bar savoring an alcoholic drink and be entertained by a local live music band. For guests who prefer not to have an alcoholic drink and skip out on the local live music, I can accomodate you by replacing the last leg of the itinerary and show you a different side of town or add in an extra food stop."}
