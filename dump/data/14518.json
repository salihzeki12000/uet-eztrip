Nakhla Al-Baraty Bey gave some of them as gifts, in 1898, when he was the overseer of the church.\u00a0The iconostasis\u00a0of the central sanctuary\u00a0is made of ebony\u00a0inlaid with ivory, and is surmounted by icons\u00a0of the Virgin Mary\u00a0and the Twelve Apostoles. The main altar (Egyptian Arabic:\u00a0haikal) screen is made of ebony inlaid with ivory that is carved into segments showing several Coptic Cross Design\u00a0that date back to around the 12th or 13th century. Over the altar screen lies a long row of seven large icons, the central one of which is Christ seated on the Throne. On one side, the icons of the Virgin Mary, Archangel Gabriel and St Peter are lined up. On the other, icons of St. John the Baptist, Archangel Michael and St. Paul."}
