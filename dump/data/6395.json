In this activity, you'll swim in deep water with the dolphins, getting a chance to experience them under water through a snorkeling mask, as well as on the surface. \n\nYou'll also get some exciting and memorable activities such as an exciting belly ride across the water (see photo), and riding a boogie board propelled by pure dolphin power as the dolphins push your feet to give you a high speed ride across the water. Small kids and adults who are not comfortable in deep water will want to do the Dolphin Encounter."}
