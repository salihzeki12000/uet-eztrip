We have a local airport here in Butuan City, therefore, a connecting flight is needed to reach our City.It is entitled \"ridge to reef adventure\" because it will include a nature park adventure, a city tour, beach and island hoppings and a visit to world class destinations of our region. This trip will also have a visit on our best food trip destinations, so for the food lovers out there(like me, this is for you). This trip is good for backpackers, friends and family. Please see my video for some of the tourist destinations in our region that I have visited:Summer in Caraga Region Philippines."}
