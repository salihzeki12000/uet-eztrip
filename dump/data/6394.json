You'll interact with real live dolphins while standing on a 3' underwater platform, rather than swimming in deep water as in the other dolphin activities.  The dolphins will give you a hug, kiss, and handshake, and let you feel and pet their special skin.  They will amaze you with their acrobatics, and high rates of speed!  In addition, you will learn about the dolphins, their habits, and their natural environment.\n\nThis dolphin encounter activity is a wonderful experience for the whole family - kids as small as 1 year old can participate.  After the activity, buy a photo or video of your actual encounter - sure to bring a smile to your face for years to come.  A real memory in Playa del Carmen."}
