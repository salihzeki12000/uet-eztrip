Here we'll pull out our helmets and lanterns and explore the inside, revealing ancient rock formations.  Back on our ATVs, we'll head for a Mayan cenote (an opening to an underground river) where we'll cool off with a swim, or you can just relax and take photos.  After we return to the Beach Club, you can spend the whole day there, eating, drinking, swimming, or just relaxing on the beautiful beach."}
