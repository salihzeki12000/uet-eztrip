For over here are many important pilgrimage centres found throughout the state. Magnificent views of the Himalayan peaks, amazing setting of the small villages dotted on the hillsides and charming local cultures \u2013 provide the perfect blend for a memorable cycling and hiking trip.\n\nRight from the coquettish charms of the sparkling Rhododendrons to the sombreness of stately Deodars, the beauty of Kumaon is best explored on the quaint rural roads atop a bicycle or on foot. Not only do you see the spectacular panorama of this land but also experience it, so as to instil in you the age old conviction that great things are born when people and mountain meet.\n\nDuring the hiking part of the tour, enhancing your experience is your few nights stay in traditional village houses which are stunningly located and have been touched up (and added on with attached bathrooms) to provide very comfortable lodging without compromising on the authenticity."}
