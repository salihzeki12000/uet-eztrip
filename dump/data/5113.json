The Huchuy Qosqo trek allows you to camp in an area that is seldom seen by tourists. Huchuy Qosqo (small Cusco) is situated above the Urubamba Valley and offers spectacular views over the Cordillera de Vilcanota mountain range. This trek is also a great way for you to enjoy a shorter trek that still includes Machu Picchu and the Inca trails (with Inca stairs that are better than the Inca Trail). You will have one night of camping in the wilderness and one night in a hostel in the beautiful pueblo of Aguas Calientes."}
