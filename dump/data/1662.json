It's different to other Vietnamese cities because it has vast natural beauties from beaches, lakes, rivers to mountains such as My Khe beach (one of the most beautiful beaches in the world), Marble mountain, etc. It is also famous for historic buildings and traditional craft villages such as Cham museum, Linh Ung pagoda, Non Nuoc village, Cam Ne village,.... \n\nWhat about food ? i just can say it's delicious. From Da Nang, you can visit Hoi An and Hue (if you want, we will discover Hoi An and Hue too). We will do anything and go anywhere like the locals do. If you want to feel like  a local for a few days, come with me. I will try my best to introduce you to the beauty of Da Nang."}
