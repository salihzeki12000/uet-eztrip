The wild rocky South coast, sandy Oriental Bay, a spectacular overview of the city from Mount Victoria finally into the city to discover some spots that make Wellington so special. There will be something for every taste. A touch of wilderness, breathtaking views, historical buildings, cool graffiti, the iconic Cuba Street, lots of unmissable photo opportunities, a sprinkle of fun and some time to enjoy the popular Wellington coffee culture and to please our hungry tastebuds. Sweet!"}
