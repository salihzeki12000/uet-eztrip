Let's start at Terreiro do Pa\u00e7o watching the river Tejo and than walk the streets of \"Rua do Ouro, Rua da Prata\" and all the typical old stores of Lisbon. We can walk up the \"Baixa de Lisboa\" and go to Rossio grab a cup of coffee or a Ginginha (tipical bevarage with cherry). I talk fluent English, Spanish and Portuguese so we can learn some words also ;)"}
