Its partner mountain is no less than the Apu Huancaure, known to be one of the first Inca settlements established when they arrived in the Cusco Valley.\n\nThis mountain has a very special profile which we can appreciate. We will also try to decipher the enigmatic archaeological site of Tipon, where a fresh water spring irrigates a ritual terrace complex; and we will see an impressive stone water channel flowing down the side of the mountain."}
