Also known as Long Beach, it offers stunning views of both the mountains, islands and a view the whole length of this 4km long beach. \n\nThe water is not only warm, but clear and calm... perfect for a chilled day out. If you're not so chilled, this is also the place to come for water sports. Here you can go jet skiing, paragliding and even have a lesson in surfing! There's something for everyone here.\n\nMany huts serve the local seafood and some of those are the best in this area. They catch it, you choose it and then BBQ it yourself. If you're not a fan of seafood, then there's always The Shack. They serve the best western food in town... from burgers to burritos. \n\nOn the return journey, you will admire the spectacular coastal views and we may turn into the stop off point for a few more photos!"}
