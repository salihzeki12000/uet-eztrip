It can be about the great flemish History, or the \"places to be\"... I think that the best way to enjoy Lille is, to walk through the picturesque streets, to relax in warm and friendly \"caf\u00e9s\", to visit sumptuous monuments, to discover typical food (the smelling cheese, up to you - but maybe you will miss something...), to stroll in green designed areas... and of course to taste our pretty good beers."}
