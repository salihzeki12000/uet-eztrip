A trained historian and museum professional, as well as former Harvard graduate student, I supplement facts and anecdotes with archival research and images to give you the most accurate and enjoyable experience possible. Not only will we see some of the typical sites of Harvard, like the old and new yards and the famous statue of three lies, I will point out some of the hidden gems of the university that your average guide may not.\u00a0I live in Cambridge and work in Boston so I am well acquainted with some of the most popular places to visit for tourists and locals alike. Delve into the history of Harvard University and some of its most notable students with me on this 2 hour walking tour that will take you all over Harvard Square."}
