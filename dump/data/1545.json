Tucked away in these little rural delights is the legacy of an ancient glorious era.\n\nThrough this tour, visit the picturesque Bundi, the very village that inspired famous author Rudyard Kipling to pen Kim. Take in the sights of fairy tale like Chittorgarh Fort that is the largest in India. Head to fascinating Mandawa village that dates back to 1755. The place has still retained the beckoning havelis and lavish mansions.  Amble through the colourful and sandy city of Bikaner."}
