Hmm,well, not mountains, or else it will call as Mountain City, hehehehehe....\n\n\nShe is not a developed city as comparing to Kuala Lumpur,federal capital of Malaysia. Thus, most of natural and old structures are preserved. It is a leisure city where it keep its slow pace of life. For those who want/need to escape from their busy life style, it is a good choice.\n\n\nHowever, if Hill City is only a place for people to relax, it is no point making a tour here, you can simply go for a spa, sauna or maybe take a good rest in you home. \n\nHill City, surrounded by hill, also famous on its cave, temple laying on the hill, and of course, food!!!
