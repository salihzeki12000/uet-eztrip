Although not many children in the cities today are exposed to paper masks, T te tradition of wearing paper masks is a cherished and endeared tradition among the locals in the countryside. Entirely handmade and always lingering with the faint smell of paper and glue, the locals love the simplicity of this craft. Note: The paper masks that you create will take a day or two to dry under the sun depending on the weather. While you will learn how to make one, the masks that you will eventually paint on and take home with you will be a ready made handmade mask that has already been dried. So what of your mask? Think about it, some child in Hanoi will wear your mask when it is eventually sold in the market."}
