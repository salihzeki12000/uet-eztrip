The first mention of the area refers to 14th\ncentury, lately here lived royal guards and artisans serving the court. In the\n19th century wealthy merchants settled here, many of whom were\npatrons of the arts. Zamoskvorechye is a proud survivor of prerevolutionary\nMoscow, as it remained relatively untouched by the replanning of the 1930s. The\narea is bursting with historic character and an old-fashioned atmosphere. A\ntour includes Pyatnitskaya and Bolshaya Ordynka Streets, \u00a0Klimentovskiy and Lavrushinsky Lanes and\nKadashevskaya embankment with numerous palaces, museums and churches built on merchants\u2019\ncontributions as a gift to Moscow."}
