While nature has endowed this land with rich forest and limestone panoramas, it is the local\u2019s works during thousands of year that has turned the mountain slopes to alluring terrace rice fields. An interesting combination of natural and man-made influence makes this breathtaking scenery become an ideal choice for a short trip from Hanoi. Let's join our tour to discover this untouched charming land of Thai and Muong ethnic communities."}
