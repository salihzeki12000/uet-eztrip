Once we get back to the main beach we will stroll over to the local fish and chip shop and get some takeaways to gorge on while sitting on the beach. You then have the choice to go for a dip in the ocean or climb Lion Rock to get the chance to experience breath taking views. This triip calls on all those keen for adventure and a good time. Anyone who loves to swim and/or go on little treks will love the journey that we will embark on."}
