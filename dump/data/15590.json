My trip allows them to become confident in just a few hours with the perfect train system here. Afterwrds they can go back to the places with confidence to do shopping and experience the areas in thier own time. They also experience four different types of travels (Big train, small trai, tram and boat) \u00a0at the same time, with a ticket that is valid for another 10 hours!"}
