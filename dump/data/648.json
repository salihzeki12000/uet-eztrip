In minutes, leave the urban metropolis behind to emerge along scenic jungle-fringed canals and minor tributaries where locals still preserve traditional ways of life not far from the city center. \nA light dinner of Vietnamese dishes will be served during your two-hour tour. Return to Saigon just after sunset to see the city\u2018s ever-changing skyline and bridges lit up spectacularly at night."}
