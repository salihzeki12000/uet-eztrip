This is a great way of getting a different perspective on the city, and in the summer period a nice way to get fresh air and (if the weather permits it) jump into the Mediterranean.\n\nThe tour starts in The Olympic Harbor and goes up the coast. From the boat you will be able to see the nice coastline of Barcelona with the Hotel W, the two towers of the Olympic Port, and inland you will see Sagrada Familia, Torre Agbar and Tibidabo.\n\nThe boat will take you up to a nice area close to Montgat where the boat will throw the anchor. Here you will be able to jump into the Mediterraean Sea while lunch is prepared. You will now enjoy a nice lunch with cold drinks and a glass of cava (Catalan champagne). There will be plenty of time to relax before the boat goes back to the Olympic Harbor."}
