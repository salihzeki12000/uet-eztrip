Build your own bamboo bike almost from scratch with the mentorship of a master bike maker right in the middle of a Nipa palm forest where the quaint workshop is. This experience spans over a week, and you wil spend 7-8 hours each day at the workshop crafting little details of your own bike. Tough work definitely, but when you see the final product emerge, you'll appreciate every single part of it, painstakingly crafted with your sweat and toil. Your teacher will always be on hand to assist with the finer details of the bike but you're free to customize and work on it as much as you want."}
