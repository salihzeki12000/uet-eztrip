In this mixture every street has a story (the same Governmental Palace that was installed by the First Spanish Conqueror is the one that\u00b4s used by our presidents today.)\n\nThen we will be visiting Miraflores District, once Lima`s first beach place it has developed into a modern district where you can find shops (From big Designers to little Artisans in a placid compilation) as well as Restaurants, Bars, Discos with nice Parks and amazing views.\n\nAs Lima is also one of the World`s Gastronomic Capitals we could choose either to eat in Lima Center or Miraflores depending on what you like, how much would you like to spend and where you want to be. I have lots of nice choices I can offer."}
