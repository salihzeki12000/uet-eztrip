Once at the top we will practice sandboarding on the many whimsical dune formations that overlook the Nazca Valley. After we had been jumping from one dune to another, we will get to the steepest section of Cerro Blanco, a great slope of sand that is over 600 meters long. Here our sandboarders receive the last instructions of our tour leader, and eventually jump down over this great slope. It is indeed a wonderful ride, full of adrenaline that offers not only fun, but also an unforgettable experience and amazing natural views."}
