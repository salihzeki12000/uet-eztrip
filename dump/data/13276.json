Mainly flat, with some steps and cobbles that can be avoided if needed. There are a number of public toilets and pubs along the way. Make sure you bring a drink, as the only stops that are planned are to take photo's. If you are wanting to spend extra time at certain points along the way, the walk may not reach the pier. Only those that have paid can join the walk, any levels of photography skills are welcome. Ideally you should have a DSLR or bridge camera, although most of the places we will visit can be taken with a mobile phone. Children are welcome as well, just give them a camera of sorts. This course is ideal for the DSLR learner as I can give you training on the basics along the way or even the experienced who want the tour to photograph the sights. I am not a historian, so don't expect a history lesson but I will throw some facts at you. Most of the photo's below were taken with my lightweight Nikon D610 with 28-300mm lens, so you don't need expensive f2.8 lenses, although do come in handy if your feeling arty."}
