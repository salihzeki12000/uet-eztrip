The bay is the home of around 50 Green Turtles that live their childhood/teenage in the bay, feeding happily from the abundant sea grass. Before getting in the water with these charming creatures you will learn a bit more about them to value the conservation efforts made all around the area. You enter the ecological center that has been taking care of the research and protection practices of the bay in the last 20 years. We want to make this experience a rich encounter where you will discover how sensitive animals they are, how badly you can harm them if you don\u2019t pay attention and how lucky you are to be there!"}
