This unique tour allows you to be exposed to Ethnic villages located in the picturesque mountains around an hours cruise from Nha Trang. Whilst the government has relocated these once proud Hill dwellers to ramshackle block houses, you still get a feel for their everyday existence. Kids with makeshift mud slides into the river , mum and the little girls doing the daily washing in the clear mountain stream, children having fun jumping from the bridge into the creek.\u00a0 Subsistence living. We often stop and hand out candy to the kids, so grab a packet or two, before you jump on board. Onwards through the lush countryside covered with sugar cane plantations and banana groves to the waterfalls. Yang Bay is much more than a waterfall. You can wander around the small zoo, check out the Black bears, and for something totally out of the ordinary, leap onto the back of an Ostrich for a wild ride. There\u2019s safe swimming in the lower reaches of the waterfalls, paddle a timber raft, sun yourself on the sand, have a fish pedicure where they exfoliate your feet, and grab a cool drink or a snack in the restaurant, plenty to do here for the family. The adventure with 4x4 Jeeps for a distance of 10 km to the Ethnic village raise more fun before getting to the final leg of the tour to Memento Country Home for a lunch of local food, including banana flower salad, roasted chicken, Vietnamese pancakes, spring rolls, soup and fruit to finish. We arrive back in Nha Trang around 3pm."}
