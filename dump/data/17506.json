A four hour tour photographing this magnificent city and beyond. You'll start at the very top of One World Trade Center, then take the PATH train from the breathtaking Santiago Calatrava designed 'Oculus' transport hub, traveling under the Hudson River to the edge of Jersey City and the magnificent views of the lower tip of Manhattan. Returning by train, you'll then walk across the iconic Brooklyn Bridge, over the East River into Brooklyn to photograph the towering and historic financial district from Brooklyn Bridge Park. All transportation fees and entrance to the One World Trade Observatory are included in the price. Please note: zoom lenses are recommended to get the full benefit. Tripods can be used throughout the trip but not at the top of One World Observatory."}
