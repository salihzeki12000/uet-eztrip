The places the guide books do not know about. These are the places I've grown up with and only the locals know about. We will visit the best place to have momos (a nepalese favourite), we will then visit an important Buddhist spiritual site and watch local handmade Buddhist artwork be made. This is all before we leave Kathmandu. After this more adventure begins, we will head to a valley in the North of Nepal and go for a 90m bungy jump! Once back to Kathmandu we will head off for a 3 day trek to a stunning village outside of Kathmandu, from here you can see once in a life time views of the Himalayan panorama!"}
