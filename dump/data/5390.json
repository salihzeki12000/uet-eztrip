Pedaling on quiet streets, along the river, crossing the hundred year old bridges, on the rice field, in contact with soft, calm and friendly locals, all make the unique experience, perhaps of the life time.| The trip nevertheless, is a real adventure by nature that requires considerable efforts especially when biking up to the Hai Van (Ocean Cloud) Pass which is renowned for its scenic beauty. Presenter Jeremy Clarkson, host of the BBC Top Gear featured the pass during the show\u2019s 2008, Vietnam Special calling the road \u201ca deserted ribbon of perfection-one of the best coast roads in the world."}
