I am a student here in Dubai who respects people from all around the word and their values . And if you are into foods you are in the right place with the right person because I am the kind of person who tries different stuff each day ;) so I know each and every corner in Dubai where you get amazing food, especially Arabic traditional and most other middle eastern food. You will ultimately have an unforgettable trip. And best of all, I have friends from almost everywhere knowing many languages so please tell me if you need someone who speaks your language so that you get the most of it. I will not charge for it."}
