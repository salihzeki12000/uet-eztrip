When lights go down, after a tiring day, is when the beat of Barcelona starts on its way back to the top. The spirits of the local people come alive at sunset and the city shows another side of itself. We Barcelonans have been raised with the idea of making the most of both sunlight and moonlight.\nFeel the evening breeze and let loose in the coolest convertible car cruising the streets of the city. We\u2019ll visit the shoreline where we\u2019ll find seaside nightlife: small bars and restaurants to relax with your close friends and companions. Some join for dinner, while others just have a drink together."}
