The tourist scene and local scene are very separated\u00a0in Amsterdam. With\u00a0this trip\u00a0I will try\u00a0show how the locals experience the city!\u00a0I will customize the trip to your wishes.\u00a0Areas I will recommend you to visit are local markets of Amsterdam Old-West or Amsterdam-East, the old industrial areas of Amsterdam-North, local fishing\u00a0villages very close to\u00a0Amsterdam like Durgerdam, the typical Amsterdam architecture in the neighborhood Spaardammerbuurt, city windmills and of course nice local places\u00a0to grab a bit\u00a0or have drink!"}
