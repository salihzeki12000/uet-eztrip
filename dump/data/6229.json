Unlike many cities in Asia, Hanoi has retained a distinct cafe culture and the market is overwhelmingly dominated by small business owners rather than generic chains.\n\nWe write a blog documenting these hidden gems at hanoihideaway.com but admittedly this is hard to follow if you are a visitor to this great city. So what we offer is a tailor made personalized half day tour. Choose 3-4 coffee shops from our blog and we will pick you up, show you around, introduce you to the people behind the scenes... and drop you back again high on caffeine."}
