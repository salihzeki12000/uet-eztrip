Our 2 days program includes the visit to the Uros floating Islands, a small community that has lived on these reed Islands for decades. This journey will take us also to the Amantani Island, an Andean community where is possible to climb to the summit of one of the hills to enjoy a great sunset, learn to dance Andean music in an evening party with the islanders and spend the night in a rural house provided by a native family. Our journey on the Lake Titicaca ends with the visit to the Taquile Islands, a traditional quechua speaking community, full of ancient agricultural terraces and some ruins dating back to the pre-Inca times."}
