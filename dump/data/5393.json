Get on your bike to face the challenge of 40km uphill riding. Enjoy the mountainous landscape on both sides of the road. You take a look at the Katu people going about their daily life: women and children having their baths in the babbling streams, carrying their firewood on their back baskets, patiently tilling their rocky gardens."}
