The flickering lights of many beautiful lanterns are the symbol of the city\u2019s historic quarters, reflecting the traditional spirit of the Vietnamese ancient city. Lanterns are the result of exchanges among Vietnamese, Japanese and Chinese cultures, which have been famous for their various and specific identities. To deeply discover the making of this beautiful item, you can opt for our trip to visit lantern making workshops to not only learn how to make the lantern, but also to get closer with Hoi An history and culture."}
