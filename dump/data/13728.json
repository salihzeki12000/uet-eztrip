We are going to spots that people from Rio goes, not places just for tourists.At Rio from the mountains, we are going to hike in 2 of the most amazing views that you ever seen. Both are really easy less than 1 hour hike untill the top. We can go in your time, dont need to rush. At one of them, we will pass by a peacefull Favela, so also you get a Favela experience inside our trip."}
