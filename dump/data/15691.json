We'll see the holiday windows of Lord and Taylor department store, Saks 5th Avenue, Tiffany and Co., and more. We'll see the Unicef Snowflake--16,000 Swarovski crystals. We'll visit St. Patricks Cathedral. And we'll tour the Rockafeller Center and the fantastic Christmas tree. We'll also visit nearby Barney's NY and Macy's. We'll go in the before the crowds get impossible, but you'll definitely want to go back at night."}
