Depending on the location of your resort we prefer our driver and personal guide to pick you up at 7:00 AM sharp! We feel it important to experience the ancient Mayan archeological site early enough to avoid the massive crowds and afternoon heat. Keep in mind it is aproximately 2 \u00bd drive from Playa Del Carmen to Chichen Itza. Since you are on a private tour we are able to stop at restrooms along the way to make your journey as comfortable as possible. Once you arrive we provide one of the top archeological guides available to enhance your visit, the tour lasts about two hours which is ample time to enjoy the site and have many photo opportunities."}
