Our day out will pleasantly unfold through a beautiful countryside area, North East of Cheshire and South West of Greater Manchester. We will visit a manor, old villages and amazing parks. For lunch you can choose between a picnic in the park (brunch) and a meal in a village pub, a local farmhouse or a vintage pub. If you love photography, there is plenty to shoot: ancient mansions, parks, horses, canal boats, traditional villages and lakes! With some luck we\u2019ll also see deer, squirrels and historical characters from another time."}
