Once you've had your fill of tourist attractions, come with me to the \"locals only\" neighborhood spots in the metro area. Based on your specific needs, we'll meet at a central location, and take the T (the nation's first metro) to some different Boston area neighborhoods that are typically reserved for those who are \"in the know.\" You'll sample cuisine, have a drink, and enjoy a true insider's experience in the city!"}
