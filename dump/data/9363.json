Most of the time it is to relax, unwind, see and experience new things and to take pictures. How about we change that view? What if we go to an entirely new city with the goal of seeing realities, immersing ourselves with local people and trying to get away with what is expected from a TYPICAL TRAVELLER which is impose by the society. How about we change what is expected to be normal and let us see travelling in an entirely new different perspective which could probably challenge our current outlook in life \u00a0:) my goal is to allow you as a guest to enjoy and share with you what I can see as a travel guide \u00a0:) and to show you the two sides of travelling."}
