Walls with etches and cracks that tell stories; stories as dark as the annals of history, and stories as beautiful as the night sky, seconds after the sun have set. Take a not-so-walk-in-the-park stroll in the famous walled city of Intramuros, and hear the stories of the walls and of its people. Maybe even grab street food while you're at it (trust me, you'll want to)."}
