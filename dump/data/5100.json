Well, maybe enjoying local beer is the thing we enjoy most. No, that's not right either...\n\nWait, I've got it! There's nothing we enjoy more than exploring a new city WHILE enjoying local craft beer. We've combined two of our favourite things to bring you \"NeighBEERhood Exploring\".  This private tour is customized to show you the in's & out's of some of our city's most vibrant neighbourhoods while sampling some suds along the way. How many beers you ask? Well that's entirely up to you! \n \nWe have put together a handful of sample itineraries to show you what type of exploring we can do. These are only samples, and can be completely customized based on the size of your group, your tastes, budget, etc. Prices listed DO NOT include the cost of beer. Due to varying tastes, consumption levels and budgets we charge only for the guide services, and leave the beer buying up to you. Flights and samples are available at all stops."}
