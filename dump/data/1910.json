Over 80% of the surface is covered with limestone and it has a high concentration of rocky peaks sitting over 2,000m above sea level.\nThe rock of Dong Van is said to contain fossils from 400 million-600 million years ago.\nThe park spreads over the districts of Meo Vac, Dong Van, Yen Minh and Quan Ba, on a total area of 2,300 square kilometers. At the center of the Rock Plateau is Dong Van Town, located 150 kilometers from the center of Ha Giang Province.\nBeside to fascinating landscapes, tourists are attracted by colorful culture of the local hill tribes with mud or wood houses and market days."}
