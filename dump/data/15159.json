It also passes through the city as experienced by the 'working class'. We see elements of what some call a divided city, a gritty and real city, a slowly Africanising city. A different tour that is safe, informative and pleasant.\u00a0The tour is a walking one and depending on your energy, can be between 2 - 6 hours, tailor-made to suit the guests. It can include a coffee on the go at any of the many world-class barista establishments and \u00a0even a light meal at any of the street-food establishments as the city is awash with sophisticated eateries serving haute cuisine close to establishments dishing out artery clogging fries and grills."}
