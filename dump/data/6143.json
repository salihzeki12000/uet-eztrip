The Yucatan beaches are natural breeding grounds for Turtles, thus there are a lot of them around. We\u2019ll take you to one of the best places on the Rivera Maya to snorkel with them. From there we\u2019ll take you to a nearby inlet where the freshwater from the Cenotes meets the sea. The water has carved out beautiful formation in the rock creating an ideal spot for all kinds of life. A truly unique experience to be seen."}
