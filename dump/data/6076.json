Take the tour together with your partner, your son or daughter, or a friend. Ofcourse you can take the tour by yourself also.\nYou have all the great experiences of our scooters tours, but without the worry of having to drive your own scooter.\nThe sidecar with motorbike attached are very large and comfortable, not to mention very unique. They attract a huge amount of attention on the road, so be sure to bring your cameras!"}
