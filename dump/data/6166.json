It is an inlet of water that was formed by a series of sink holes. It is a lagoon of fresh water that mixes with salt water as it is connected to the sea. This combination of sweet and salt water, cold and warm causes a brackish effect. This effect has the look of cloudyness or looking through oil but it is just the two waters mixing."}
