The name is due to its unique rocky, rugged and cut shape coastline, composed of small coves surrounded by pine forests and lapped by crystal water. \n\nIts natural wealth and beauty is apparent in several territories and protected areas, such us Cap de Creus, the Emporda Marshes and the Marine Reserve Medes islands. \n\nThe fame of Costa Brava is also due to its villages. Small fisherman towns, with whitewashed walls and narrow winding streets, today still retain their charm. \n\nThis area has historically been a point of entry, transit, and settlement for different cultures and civilizations. Each has left its footprints until nowadays."}
