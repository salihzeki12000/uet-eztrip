We will venture down to the Embarcadero and get some of the most iconic shots of the bay, while getting insight from a local who knows special tricks that most visitors will miss. Sure, you will get the iconic shots of the city that everyone has to get but this triip also encourages you to look outside the box and put yourself into the environment of the financial district."}
