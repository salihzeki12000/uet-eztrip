Of all the ways to immerse yourself in Nature, paragliding is intense, serene and simple, playing with natural forces such as gravity -- no fuel! Just imagine the feeling and experience, not to mention the fresh air and freedom of the sky! :D Whether as a special experience, to highlight a celebration, or perhaps the spark of a new passion, paragliding is a unique experience. This particular package supports a local paragliding family and people who live and love paragliding year round and worldwide. Thanks very much to Freeminds.ch for 'freemindedness' and sharing! :)"}
