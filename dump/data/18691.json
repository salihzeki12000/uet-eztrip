But the new breed of professionals and college\n          goers from all over the country, seem to have taken the responsibility\n          of giving it a new name - Cybercity or Shopper's Paradise. Sitting\n          gracefully on the cotton-rich Deccan Plateau, Pune is the second\n          important city in the state after Mumbai. Rich with the heritage of\n          old bungalows endured with flower gardens and decaying wadas, the city\n          blend itself well with the modernization and is going global with\n          malls, multiplexes, pubs and the Semi-Metro tag."}
