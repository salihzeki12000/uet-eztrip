This trip will bring you flashback of Surabaya's historical place. Start from visiting the Hero's Monument, House of Sampoerna Museum where you can see how woman make 325 cigarettes per hour manually; you will visit Suramadu- the longest bridge in Indonesia, then check out the old graveyard of the colonial Dutch, English and German - Hitler graveyard; 4 face Buddha statue in Kenjeran beach/ Also, you will walk around Arabian Village in Ampel Street & traditional market, drink fresh coconut water, feel the wind blowing in coastal mangrove, buy traditional souvenirs in Mirota. \nFor the food and beverage, Surabaya is the best place to look for spicy food. I will bring you to any local traditional food restaurant from the lowest to the highest price but with the best taste and quality.\nAnd when the sunset comes, we can chill out in cafe, grab some drink, enjoy the music and meet new friends. Start on Matchboxx Too, Lava Lounge cafe, or Lido Western Bar where you can feel like cowboy without a cow.\nSo enjoy the trip from dusk till dawn...."}
