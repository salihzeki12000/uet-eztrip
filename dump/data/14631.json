My goal is to simplify the Southern California wine \ntasting experience, offering a fun, easy alternative to driving yourself\n or hiring a limousine. As you travel the rolling countryside in \nTemecula Valley or Santa Barbara, your guide (and wine expert) educates \nyou on tasting techniques and the area\u2019s crops and vintages. You\u2019ll stop\n at some of my favorite local vineyards for the opportunity to sip a variety \nof vintages; after the sampling rooms, you\u2019ll have a chance to discover \nthe area on your own. Whether you want to buy a few bottles to take \nhome, keep it to a quaint village stroll or try your luck at the casino \nis up to you. Then it\u2019s back for the journey home.\u00a0 \n      Its about a 10 round trip."}
