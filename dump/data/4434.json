However you might feel a bit \"monument-ed out\" by the end of it. We top it off with a trip to Beijing's most touristy market - Xiushui Silk Market. Its better if you can stretch this itinerary over two days and add in some other items, we suggest you check our two and three day itineraries. Also this tour does not get you to the Great Wall, but we have another one day tour which does."}
