This beautiful and serene city is made up of 14 main islands, while the\ntotal number of islands in Greater Stockholm & the Archipelago amounts to\nover 30,000. We will visit four of the main islands at a comfortable walking pace. You will have time to take pictures, have a quick fika (Swedish for 'coffee & something sweet'; often a cinnamon roll) & visit a souvenir shop or two while on the tour. If you are lucky, we may take a short ride on an old Swedish tram from the island of Djurgarden back to the city center."}
