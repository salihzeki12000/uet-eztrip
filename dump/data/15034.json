The dictator would later refer to Munich as \u201cthe capital\nof the movement\u201d (Hauptstadt der Bewegung), making plans for rebuilding it in\nhis own image. Is there any trace of this fallen ideal left? If yes, what do\nthose traces mean to us today and what can we learn from their fall? In this program, we shall walk among the ruins of this past, revisiting one of the\ndarkest chapters of our history while discussing questions such as \u201cwhy?\u201d and \u201chow?\u201d."}
