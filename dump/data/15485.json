I will show this city by my car so it will be comfortable and we can make a break, stop anywhere we like!!! Definitely \u00a0i'll comment on everything we see. Any questions are welcome! We will start from old Dubai and it's heritage areas (gold souq-market, local abra boats station, Deira). Through heart of the city and its main luxury must-see points (Sheikh Zayed road with its above the ground metro, world's tallest Burj Khalifa, \u00a0world's famous Dubai mall). We will continue to sea side (amazing views of Persian gulf, beaches, luxury sea side Jumeirah road and world's expensive hotel Burj al Arab, sheikh's wifes palaces, Dubai marina area). We will finalise by reaching Dubai-Abu-Dhabi border. So we will cross Dubai from the beginning to the end with comfortable, friendly and relaxed atmosphere."}
