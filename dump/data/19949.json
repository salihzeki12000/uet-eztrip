The Altais with their eternal snow, glacier, and traces of ancient ice covers have been well preserved due to the constantly cold climate and strong winds. The area is inhabited by some endangered animals (such as the Argali sheep, ibex, snow leopardm rock ptarmigan and altai snowcock) and plants (such as the dwarf siberian pine and white gentiana). The Altais also contain Potanin, the largest glacier in the country."}
