Hiking trails, nature, scenery, and a killer view is what this spot has to offer. I've personally done a few photoshoots at this location just because of how gorgeous it is in all the seasons from spring to fall. Discover a relaxing yet adventurous experience when hiking through these trails in a quiet spot in Roseville that not many people know about! You'll have to experience it to believe it. And trust me, you'll fall in love with this spot just a little outside of the Sacramento area in the beautiful city of Roseville."}
