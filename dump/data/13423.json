We are going to start our walk in front of Loro Parque in Puerto de la Cruz (easy to find meeting point) and follow the coastal walk for a few kilometers. On our way, we will walk along beautiful cliff coast, pass the beautiful little coastal town Toscal, spot a picturesque ruin by the ocean (photo spot!!!), walk through a beautiful palm grove, visit a spring and as biggest highlight, we will visit a beautiful black sand beach, which is top secret and rarely visited by tourists.By the way, the walk is moderate, so you need to have a good level of fitness, we will be walking up- and downhill for several hours. Please bring comfy shoes, enough water and some snacks."}
