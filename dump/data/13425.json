This trip gave me chance to see some beautiful Indian architecture from 1200, and some great country side view of rural India. I covered a beautiful lake on the way at Malavalli Village, which is a paradise for bird photographers and finally a visit to the famous wooden toy stores, home decors of Channapatna town of Karnataka. The artifacts here are known for their handcrafted artistic touch, rich Indian colors and a display of our cultural old ways.All this on my bike in one day travelling around 300 km to and back from Bangalore"}
