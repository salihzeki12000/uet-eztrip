Don't get me wrong, i love eating healthy while keep it under budget to save up our spending for much more worthwhile activities during the adventure, yet however, there are numerous and interesting spots of foods and drinks that can be incredibly impressive which we could easily miss out any minutes now if we decide not to be adventurous, so why wait? Follow me, i\"ll introduce you a full day fill with delicious things in Melbourne, i promise, it will be as amusing, impressive, affordable and of course, as fun as you expect for our adventure to be. Are you ready because I am if you are :)"}
