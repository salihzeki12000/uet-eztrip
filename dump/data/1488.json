Make way through the waves of dunes along with rugged dried driver beds for an exciting experience. Amble through rural hamlets and get an insight into the Rajasthani village life. Stay in a tented camp that is the best way to get a feel of the splendid surroundings. In the evening seek comfort by the warmth of the campfire and relish in the barbeque dinner."}
