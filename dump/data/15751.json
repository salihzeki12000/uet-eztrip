The waters at\u00a0Shelly beach are very shallow with depths ranging from 2 to 6 metres - this makes it perfect for beginners.!\u00a0I am a marine biology student with qualifications in water safety and have plenty of experience should you feel hesitant to partake. \u00a0Unlike a lot of beach-trips, mine includes a bush walk around the area and children ages 6 onward are welcome. \u00a0You don't need to go to Queensland to see some of Australia's most beautiful Marine life, nor do you need to pay scads of money to learn about Sydney's coastline heritage, punt across the city for the freshest fish, coldest beer or best company - it's all here!"}
