Then reality sets back in on Monday and we all at some point get the mid-week blues. I want to give you a mid-week pick-me-up! With this tour, I can show you Wednesdays can be fun for you, your family, friends, or coworkers. You'll experience some of Toronto's awesome culture, all while staying within your budget. Whether you're from the city and wanting something to do or if you're visiting and trying to fill up your days with some fun and food, come join me!"}
