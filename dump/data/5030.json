The Cachicata trek will take you past high waterfalls, Inca ruins and beautiful scenery. \nThe Cachicata trek is not as physically demanding as other treks in the region which makes it perfect for families travelling with children or anyone wishing for a more relaxed route to Machu Picchu. Since this trek is new, it is not yet as popular as many of the other treks around Cusco. This means that you will have less crowds and a more peaceful trekking experience."}
