The programme will be adjusted every time according to the time of the year, the weather and the average age of the group. It is recommended to join groups of similar age and preferences, there will be a simple questionnaire to fill and suggestions will be made in order to maximize your trip experience by creating friendly groups. The trip is not addressed only to tourists but also to students; foreign and Greek, ex-pats of all ages, Greeks from all places and even Athenians who want to spend a fun day with like-minded people while learning a bit more about their city or just enjoy its beauties with a travel expert, me!"}
