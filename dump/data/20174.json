If you take great pleasure in cuisine, you have had lots of amazing Vietnamese foods. When you want to do something new, that\u2019s where we are. We don\u2019t try to serve you the best meal of your life at Cyclo Resto. But day by day, we try the best to bring full feeling of cuisine. Coming to us and self-cook with chef\u2019s direction is the best way to get real experience."}
