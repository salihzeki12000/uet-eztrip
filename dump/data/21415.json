Begin your day by walking beneath the River Thames and emerge on the other side, coming face to face with the epic tea ship The Cutty Sark. Look onboard and make your way past the Greenwich shoreline, being sure to catch a glimpse of the mudlarkers hunting for treasure below. We then make our way into the Old Royal Naval College, where you\u2019ll hear tales of the former Palace which once stood here and stories of the Tudors."}
