It is located north west of Hanoi at an elevation of almost 1,200 meters, surrounded by sheer cliffs and jungle. Because of its height above sea level the temperature remains pleasant and comfortable year round. These days Tam Dao is popular with day-trippers from Hanoi who wish to escape the heat and stress of city life."}
