You will have the chance to stop by a lacquer ware factory to see some amazing examples of craftsmanship and traditional Vietnamese images. Pop in and see the soon to be finished war memorial of Tam Giac Sat (Iron Triangle).  Stop by a lakeside restaurant and sample some lovely dishes while taking in the peaceful atmosphere of the countryside.  After lunch, ride your bike onto a ferry and make a river crossing  to the famed Cu Chi tunnels.  There you will see how the Vietnamese people resisted both the French colonization and the American invasion."}
