The traffic is relatively mild, so moving around wouldn't be an issue. Sunday is also when locals go outs in the morning to exercise and chill in the afternoon/evening.\n\nItinerary-wise, you'll have the chance to visit a massive (and the only well-rehabilitated) mangrove forest in Jakarta and sample delicious Javanese (not Japanese) delicacies or fresh seafood."}
