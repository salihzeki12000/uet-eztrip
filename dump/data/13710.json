Weekend breakfast with family and friends can take hours of chatting, eating and tea drinking. While there are many places in the city you can eat nice breakfasts, none of them can compete with \u00c7ak\u0131rlar - a village near Antalya that is famous for breakfast. Locals come here every Sunday to leave for a few hours the tumult of the city behind. Other days of the week it is a more peacefull experience - strongly advised! Just come and taste for yourself. If you happen to come here on Sunday, there is a small market you can walk through."}
