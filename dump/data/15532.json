Street food like tamales and tacos, and all sorts of local delicacies await at every corner. We also have some of the best restaurants in the world, with clear prehispanic and latin influences. Mercado Roma is the perfect example of this; you will find over fifty stands of food, organic and local products, beers and mezcal... You'll also find pozole, barbacoa or tortas, some of the most representative of our typical foods. But there are also some new restaurants, selling hamburgers, pizzas or tapas. This place offers lots of different options that will show you what true mexican food is."}
