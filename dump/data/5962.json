Plus, we\u2019ll find no crowd at the front door. Come visit these architectural marvels scattered about, yet unknown on standard tourist routes. We\u2019ll see Gaud\u00ed's early works: a convent, a spectacular family house, a prospective museum and different pieces of urban decoration, like gates, lamps and walls.\nGaud\u00ed\u2019s arching success has often overshadowed the work of other Modernista \u2013Catalan Art Nouveau\u2013 architects. So let\u2019s explore some architectural masterpieces by Dom\u00e8nech i Montaner, Jujol and Puig i Cadafalch, such as Palau de la M\u00fasica, Hospital de Sant Pau, Casa de les Punxes, Casa Thomas, Casa Llopis, Palau Macaya, Casa Muley Afid and Casa Planells.\nL\u2019Eixample is the neighbourhood with the highest density of works, many of them UNESCO World Heritage Sites. We will follow our own itinerary, trying not only to see the best places but also to travel to Barcelona\u2019s flourishing and controversial past at the end of the 19th century and early 20th century.\nI highly recommend going to see at least one work on the outskirts: the Gaud\u00ed Crypt Col\u00f2nia G\u00fcell (10 km). Another unfinished project related to a church (though not to be confused with the Sagrada Familia), it is located in a Modernista village that was set up to house the workers at the G\u00fcell family\u2019s textile factory and has been preserved just as it was. Trust me, you don\u2019t want to miss it.\nAnd remember that the itinerary can be tailored to your interests. Just let me know!"}
