Some people consider Graffiti a crime, others, a piece of art. Guess which one I am. These alleys are flooded with unique artwork. Many artists are famous in the city. My personal favourite way to experience these alleys is to walk, although I do love biking as well. We can start in the heart of downtown and walk west or do it the other way round. The best part about walking east is that we will end up in the Trinity Bellwoods Park. One of the largest in the city. I like to end that trip at Bellwoods brewery, one of the most amazing micro breweries in Canada. Of course if you walk east you end up in the heart of downtown, where there is a fantastic concert or restaurant every fifteen feet. Either way it is an amazing way to have an adventure, just slightly off the grid."}
