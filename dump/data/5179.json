It is the lowest in altitude (4350 meters) of the 3 alternative treks and also the shortest in distance (17 kilometers) but still sees some great examples of Inca Stairs and other Inca ruins along the way. As there are only 2 days of trekking, you will only camp for one night and then sleep in our Hotel on the next night. This trek is also available in 1 or 2 day versions as well (without Machu Picchu)."}
