In the past three years, we've gone from instant coffee drinking people to Starbuck addict to finally embracing the true potential of coffee, the beans to bar concept. \n\nWe'll be coffee hopping from the first coffee shop that started the 'movement' to some of the leading ones. These are the coffee shop that took the extra effort to maintain the quality of their coffee right from the farmers to roasting their own. \n\nIf we're lucky we'll get to meet with the founders and chat on everything you'd like to know about the industry. On the list is a coffee shop run by the official Indonesia Barista Champion 2013 and Indonesia Latte Art Champion 2013. \n\nAdditional Trip: We can also pay a visit to the old-school kopitiam style coffee house if you like."}
