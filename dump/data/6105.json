First of all, it's situated by four natural lakes, which is a rare sight in the Yucatan peninsula.\n \nThese lakes are believed to have given the city its name, which means \"Waters stirred by wind\". Furthermore, it is not as excavated nor reconstructed as Chichen Itza or Tulum.\n \nCoba still has a number of big structures covered with the growth of the jungle, making it a wild place that truly triggers your imagination. It doesn't see nearly as many visitors as Chichen Itza or Tulum and if we are lucky we might be all by ourself with only Birds, Monkeys and the dense jungle to accompany you at these mystical ruins. After we see the ruins we go to the beautiful  Cenote and than enjoy a late lunch at world famous \u201cOscar & Lalo Restaurant, Bar & Grill\u201d."}
