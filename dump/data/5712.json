It has been registered over 300 petroglyphs. The Petroglyphs of Chichictara are perhaps one of the earliest expressions of writing of the Peruvian ancient past. Among the figures visitors may see dozens of wonderful representations such as: Condors, Andean felines, snakes, Llamas, Andean deers and many others. This archaeological zone is located just one hour away from the city of Nazca, passing the famous Nazca Lines desert."}
