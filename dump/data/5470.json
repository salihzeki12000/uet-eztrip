There will be many opportunities to learn something about the city and its cultures. Why do we call the bartender \u201eK\u00f6bes\u201c? How do you order a K\u00f6lsch and what exactely is Altbier? Why did it take such a long time to finish the Dom and why is the City Hall far more than only a house for the citizens? You see, we will not only have the joy of drinking but it will also be a real cultural trip!"}
