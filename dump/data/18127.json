The city now becomes a shimmering, colorful and exciting with night activities. The adventurous excursion is combined with the riding of vintage Vespa through some landmarks in the city and tasting the local cuisine. A night of fun and amazement start with a cruise through the bustling streets, narrow alleys, important monuments, beautiful tree-lined avenues all with a rich hidden history and tradition. Be sure you come with the empty stomach because during your journey, you will stop to enjoy some of the local specialties that are only found in Hanoi. Go deep into the nightlife while being driven to local bars and lounges where the young generation and even the older people come to unwind and flaunt their unique styles."}
