This Quechua word gives its name to the southern province of Cusco where this magnificent archaeological site is located.\n\nBuilt on the top of the mountain, Waqra Pukara offers us a view of mountain ranges that disappear into the horizon, as well as gigantic rock formations which give depth to the valley of the Apurimac River. The ecological levels we will visit are Quechua, suni and puna, observing the characteristic flora and fauna of each one."}
