They have inspired more than one artist, including Ridley Scott for his 1982 cult film \u201cBlade Runner\u201d. Join us on a colorful journey after dark where giant neon billboards match trails of light left by the bustling traffic whizzing around.\n\nOn this \u201cTokyo By Night\u201d photo tour we visit the city\u2019s famous night scenes: Shibuya and Shinjuku. We hit the heart of the metropolis where lights never turn off. We visit iconic locations and lesser known, yet not to be missed, corners of the city. We\u2019ll give you insiders spot recommendations and composition tips. You\u2019ll also learn how to use your tripod and long exposure to your advantage in low light situations."}
