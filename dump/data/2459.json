What a fascinating experience to enjoy the delightfulness of water puppetry, a Vietnamese unique traditional stage art, performed on the water surface with accompaniment of live orchestra! A romantic dinner cruise along the tranquil Saigon River is truly a short retreat from the bustling ambiance of Ho Chi Minh. The trip will be more complete with a short window sightseeing tour in the city centre to contemplate French-style colonial architectures in contrast with splendidly lighted modern sky-scrapers."}
