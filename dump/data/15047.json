Paris has so much to offer that sometimes it's best to keep a tour limited to just a few locations and a smaller itinerary, allowing you to relax whilst taking in the sights and views Paris has to offer. On this trip we will taste some French coffee from a cute caf\u00e9,\u00a0savour a delicious \"Amelie style\" cr\u00e9pe alongside a picturesque carousel, then work it off by\u00a0climbing the steps through the gorgeous village of Montmartre to the\u00a0Sacr\u00e9-C\u0153ur."}
