All the chaos of traffics, people, restaurants, mini-enterprises, temples, markets, noises and smells make Cho Lon are so fascinating. It is hugely different from other Chinatowns in other countries which are mainly about for food and souvenirs.\n4hours walking tour or 2hours cyclo tour is perfect for Chinatown.\nI created this tour after a special request of an American couple who are interested in local markets and experiences"}
