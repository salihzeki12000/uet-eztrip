Not mentioning all the activities that a traveller could experience. But what makes the trip more special is the history that envelopes the Ilocos region and the culture of the people who have been residing in the region. As we travel around Ilocos Sur (South) and Ilocos Norte (North), there are a lot of historical landmarks as we move to each places. Travelling to Ilocos region is like a time machine going back to Spanish era."}
